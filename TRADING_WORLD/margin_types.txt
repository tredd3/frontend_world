//Margin Types
—Value at Risk (VAR) refers to the potential loss that might occur while dealing with securities for a given timeframe. VAR margin is required to cover up for the losses arising due to uncertain risk conditions.
VAR margins are covered for a single day for Liquid securities and three days for illiquid securities.
—Extreme Loss Margin (ELM) is the margin blocked in addition to the VAR margin. ELM is blocked for risk situations that are not covered in the VAR estimation.
—Adhoc Margins are special margins blocked on specific securities depending on the nature of the security. Adhoc margins are denoted as ‘delivery margin
For e.g: exchanges add ad-hoc margin requirements owing to volatility or physical delivery margins to stock F&O contracts in the last week of expiry
—Tender Margin
Mostly for Crude Oil & Natural Gas contracts
The additional tender margin on commodities is charged to cover the risk of large price fluctuations in commodity contracts that can happen close to expiry. 
The additional margin amount (also called the pre-expiry or tender margin) is blocked from your commodity account funds under the ‘delivery margin’ field

Note: any insufficient margin (VAR+ELM+Adhoc) may lead to a Margin penalty

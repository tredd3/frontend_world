Futures:
   Standardised
   No Counterparty risk - regulated and margin maintenance by broker
   No Liquidity risk - traded on the exchange
   Underlying - bonds/equity/interest rates/gold/currency/index
   Lot size - minimum quantity
   Contract size/value = lot size *  future price
   For contract to be created on the exchange both buy and seller must exist
      I.e if buyer buys a contract at certain price a seller must be willing to sell at that price - otherwise
      Contract for that particular price can’t be created

   //MARGIN
   To enter into a futures agreement, one must deposit a margin amount, a certain % of  the contract  value
   For e.g:  Margin = 18% of contract value (why 18% bcoz exchange/broker thinks the asset value can’t go  below 18% in a given day and they stop trading if it goes below say 15%(lower circuit) and go for a margin  call )
   Note: The margins requirement for both short and long trades are similar
   Initial Margin = span margin + exposure margin (this is collected at the time of entering a position)
    SPAN margin is monitored and collected at the time of placing an order and is revised by the exchanges throughout the day. 
    Exposure margin is charged over and above SPAN margin by the exchanges to cover risks that may not be covered by the SPAN margin.
   Why margin? : to compensate the counterparty incase buyer/seller  defaults
   Margin requirement keeps changing multiple times in a day based on Volatility/Risk of the entire portfolio
   More Volatility/Risk more margin needed 
   If margin is not maintained with the broker - margin call will happen and if you don't respond broker can sell/square off your position 
   Margin gets unblocked if position is squared off
   Note: risk reduces margin reduces ( For e.g: margin goes down if you have both long & short positions on contracts )

   //contract types - 3 expiry contacts in F/O segment
  The contract belonging to the current month is called ‘Current Month Contract’ /near month contract/prompt contract
   near month contract - is the active contract with the shortest time to maturity
  the next month contract is called ‘Mid Month’/next month contract
  the 3rd one is called “Far Month Contract.’ 
   The current month contract expires on every expiry, and a new far month contract is introduced. 
   The mid-month contract would graduate to the current month contract in the process.


//LEVERAGE
Pay small amount(margin) to buy a big asset, P&L is calculated on the actual asset and not the margin
 You pay - giving >100% gains
Leverage = Contract value/Margin (invested amount)
E.g: 20x leverage : 1% movement in underlying price ur  p&l moves by +/- 20% 
So 5% upward movement can double ur invested money (margin) 
Also 5% downward movement can ZERO  ur invested money (margin) 

//Payoffs
Profit & loss graph is linear

//settlement - physical & cash settlement
 If the future contract is held on the date of expiry , then settlement happens
 Settlement price - closing price of future on expiry date
  p&l = lot size * ( Settlement price - avg purchase price)
 Physical settlement :
   As we move closer to settlement date/expiry date the margin requirement for buyer keeps increasing bcoz he needs to honour the contract
   Also seller is supposed to hold the actual underlying (commodity/stock etc)
 Cash settlement :
      Now if the buyer is at profit, seller margin is debited, buyer trading account is credited
      If buyer is at loss i.e seller is at profit, buyer margin is debited, seller trading account is credited
    Intra day - buy & sell on the day
       MTM(mark to market) is calculated on (Avg buy/sell price - last close price)* lots
     Overnight - buy , hold for multiple days and sell
       MTM(mark to market) is calculated on a daily basis and gets credited and debited from the trading  
       account  But ultimately it burns down to the formula used in intraday
       Reason for daily MTM in overnight - futures can be sold before expiry date hence daily settlement
       clears  complication


//Open interest - Abnormally high OI indicates high leverage
Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts that have not been settled. 
It is carry forwarded till the expiry date based on positions taken/exited by the traders
OI increases when new contracts are added. OI decreases when contracts are squared off.
OI does not change when contracts are transferred from one party to another.
Square off/sell/exit a position : transfer the contract to someone else (but this doesn’t close the contract)or close out the contact.
Close out : taking out an equal but opposite contract to your existing one.
 For e.g: To close out of a long position you would take a short position with the same future price that You bought and viceversa
    //if a long trader squares of his position then contract close out might or might not happen
    case 1: if a long trader squares off and short trader with that particular contract buys it then both members 
    positions are squared off and the contract itself is closed or removed from the exchange and OI DECREASES, Volume increases
    case 2: if a long trader squares off and a trader short on other contract buys it or a trader long on the contract buys it
      then your position is squared off but the contract is not closed out and here OI REMIANS SAME, Volume increases

    //if a short trader squares of his position then contract close will 100% happen
    case 1: if a short trader is willing to go long for the contracts which he has shorted and the long trader is willing to go
      short then both members positions are squared off and the contract itself is closed or removed from the exchange and OI DECREASES, Volume increases


//Volume
No of transactions taken place per day
Always start with zero every day
Transactions always increase in a given day - bcoz both opening & closing contracts contribute to volume
    Bcoz each action is considered a transaction

//Market wide position limit
 Contracts cannot be unlimited
 The maximum contracts that can exist in the system is limited by exchange
Contract ban period - if  95%  of that limit is reached no new contact either short/long is allowed
Once the exiting positions are closed then contract creation is resumed

//circuits/dynamic price range
Price bans set by the exchange to limit the large movement of price for a single day
And hence trading is banned for 15 min (cooling off period)
It depends on security and the liquidity

//Shorting
1. One can only short on an intraday basis in the spot market.
2. The short positions cannot be carried overnight in the spot market.
3. The short position in the futures market can be carried forward overnight.

//Roll over
What is roll over?
  Traders roll over futures contracts to switch from the front month contract that is close to expiration 
      to another contract in a further-out month. 
  The roll involves selling the front-month contract already held to buy a similar contract but with longer time to maturity.

Why roll over?
    They are rolled over to a different month to avoid the costs and obligations associated with physical settlement
    Traders will roll over futures contracts that are about to expire to a longer-dated contract in order to
        maintain the same position following expiry.

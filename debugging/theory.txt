//source map
Source map is used for debugging transpiled/minified files in production or transpiled files in development.
Source map is a json file (filename.js.map)which is generated using build and other tools like web pack etc which contains info of  what all files are transpiled/minified in to one.
sorucemappingurl directive is added by web pack at the end of minified/transpiled file with the info of original files.
On opening dev tools if source maps option is enabled in the browser settings then browser will look for sourcemappingurl in the minified file
And based on that it will fetch/download the corresponding original files which can be used for debugging.
If it is a secure site like banking or u want to protect the code from others use fiddler.

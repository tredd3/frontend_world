//buffer - small Location in RAM where binary data stream is stored temporarily by node 
while processing it or sending to any other process.

There is a minimum and a maximum amount of data a process could take over time.
So if the rate the data arrives is faster than the rate the process consumes the data, 
the excess data need to wait somewhere for its turn to be processed.
On the other hand, if the process is consuming the data faster than it arrives, the few data that 
arrive earlier need to wait for a certain amount of data to arrive before being sent out for processing.

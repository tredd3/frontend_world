// Images
There are two types of images to consider:�vector images�and�raster images. For raster images, you also need to choose the right compression format, for example:�GIF,�PNG,�JPG
vector images� can be scaled without any loss in quality or change in file size.
Include image Optimization and compression tools into your workflow to reduce file sizes
reduce the number of http requests by placing frequently used images into image sprites
Lazy loading - I.e loading the images when they appear on viewport till then use a placeholder image of equal size

**Typed Arrays are array-like objects that provide a mechanism for reading and writing raw binary data in memory buffers/blobs
raw binary data - audio, video, image, file
Each entry in a JavaScript typed array is a raw binary value in one of a number of supported formats, from 8-bit integers to 64-bit floating-point numbers.
Not all methods available for normal arrays are supported by typed arrays (as they are array like objects and not arrays)
convert typed array in to an array using array.from() or Array.prototype.slice.call(typedArray);
/Buffers and views: typed array architecture
 A buffer (implemented by the ArrayBuffer object) is an object representing a chunk of data; it has no format to speak of and 
 offers no mechanism for accessing its contents. In order to access the memory contained in a buffer, you need to use a view.
A view provides a context — that is, a data type, starting offset, and the number of elements — that turns the data into a typed array.
**The ArrayBuffer is a data type that is used to represent a generic, fixed-length binary data buffer. 
You can't directly manipulate the contents of an ArrayBuffer; instead, you create a typed array view 
or a DataView which represents the buffer in a specific format, and use that to read and write the contents of the buffer.
Typed array views are in the native byte-order of your platform. 
With a DataView you are able to control the byte-order.
new ArrayBuffer(length) - creates a new ArrayBuffer in the memory of the given length in bytes and intialises them to 0
var buffer = new ArrayBuffer(8);
var view   = new Int32Array(buffer);//reads 32 bits at a time 8*8/32 = 2 items in the array[0,0] 
each item in a view is represented as 32 bits
var view   = new Float64Array(buffer);//reads 64 bits a time [0] - each item represented as 64 bits

ArrayBuffer and views are a part of ECMA standard, a part of JavaScript.
To manipulate/iterate an ArrayBuffer, we need to use a “view” object.(either typed array or dataview)

Blob: In the browser, there are additional higher-level objects, like Blob described in File API
Blob objects are immutable - We can’t change data directly in a Blob, but we can slice parts of a Blob, create new Blob objects from them, mix them into a new Blob and so on.
This behavior is similar to JavaScript strings: we can’t change a character in a string, but we can make a new corrected string.
FileReader object is used to  read data from Blobs in multiple formats.
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader - for input upload, drag and drop 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_Access_API - access complete user file system after permissions


why we need Blob when we have Array Buffer?
ArrayBuffer is a memory area. What’s stored in it? It has no clue. Just a raw sequence of bytes.
Blob represents “binary data with type” - That makes Blobs convenient for upload/download operations in the browser.
We can easily convert between Blob and low-level binary data types:
We can make a Blob from a typed array using new Blob(...) constructor.
We can get back ArrayBuffer from a Blob using FileReader, and then create a view over it for low-level binary processing.

//file handling - downloads and sending over network
https://javascript.info/file
File objects inherit from Blob.
In addition to Blob methods and properties, File objects also have name and lastModified properties, plus the internal ability to read from filesystem. We usually get File objects from user input, like <input> or Drag’n’Drop events (ondragend).
FileReader objects can read from a file or a blob, in one of three formats:

String (readAsText).
ArrayBuffer (readAsArrayBuffer).
Data url, base-64 encoded (readAsDataURL).
In many cases though, we don’t have to read the file contents. Just as we did with blobs, we can create a short url with URL.createObjectURL(file) and assign it to <a> or <img>. This way the file can be downloaded or shown up as an image, as a part of canvas etc.

And if we’re going to send a File over a network, that’s also easy: network API like XMLHttpRequest or fetch natively accepts File objects.

//A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network.
socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that data is destined to be sent to.
An endpoint is a combination of an IP address and a port number.


****** web sockets *********
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket

websockets - like http it is a communication protocol | considered as a upgradation to http protocol
used make a TCP connection once and then bidirectional communication between client and server on the same TCP connection
used in real time data transfer applications like chat/trading/online gaming 

**how browser establishes web socket connection - high level details
WebSocket "is designed to work over HTTP ports 80 and 443 as well as to support HTTP proxies and intermediaries
HTTP servers typically interpret Web Socket handshakes as an Upgrade request.
1)client establishes a connection through a process known as Web Socket handshake, for which the server returns a WebSocket handshake response
The process begins with the client sending a regular HTTP request to the server:
GET /chat HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Key: x3JJHMbDL1EzLkh9GBhXDw==
Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat, superchat
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
Origin: http://example.com

/Server response:
HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Accept: HSmrc0sMlYUkAGmm5OPpG2HaGWk=
Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat

2)Once the connection is established, communication switches to a bidirectional binary protocol which does not conform to the HTTP protocol.
WebSocket transmissions are described as "messages", where a single message can optionally be split across several data frames. 
WebSocket requests are not restricted by the Same-origin policy. Therefore WebSocket servers must validate the "Origin" header
 against the expected origins during connection establishment, to avoid Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking attacks 
It is better to use tokens or similar protection mechanisms to authenticate the WebSocket connection when sensitive (private) data is being transferred 


***** other stuff ****

fan-in : all the client requests coming to a server
fan-out: requests going from server to clients
problem with fan-out is if million users are to be notified then server gets crashed
so use rate limiting (1000 requests/sec etc)
*SSE - server sent events - client initiates the SSE connection using EventSource API (server uses event source protocol)
The client canâ€™t send any data to the server after the initial handshake.
EventSource instance opens a persistent connection to an HTTP server, which sends events in text/event-stream format. 
The connection remains open until closed by calling EventSource.close().
Examples: Facebook/Twitter updates, stock price updates, news feeds, sport results or delivering 
data into a client-side storage mechanism like IndexedDB or web storage etc where a user interaction is not needed

const sse = new EventSource('/api/v1/sse');
  
  based on the type of events sent by the server we can listen to those specific events 
  /* This will listen only for events with event type notice */
 
  sse.addEventListener("notice", function(e) { 
    console.log(e.data)
  })

  /* Similarly, this will listen for events  with the field `event: update` */
  sse.addEventListener("update", function(e) {
    console.log(e.data)
  })

  sse.addEventListener("message", function(e) {
    console.log(e.data)
  })


https://socket.io/docs/
**socket.io - js library for web sockets (just like jquery is to javascript)
handles fallback(if client and server doesn't agree on handshake then uses long polling as a 
fallback mechanism to support old browsers) and auto-reconnection
features: broadcasting to multiple sockets, storing data associated with each client, and asynchronous I/O.
use cases: Real-time analytics, Binary streaming(audio, video and image), chat, Document collaboration (concurrently edit a document and see each other's changes)
Socket.IO is not a WebSocket library with fallback options to other realtime protocols.
 It is a custom realtime transport protocol implementation on top of other realtime protocols
 A Socket.IO implementing server cannot connect to a non-Socket.IO WebSocket client.
 A Socket.IO implementing client cannot talk to a non-Socket.IO WebSocket or Long Polling Comet server. 
Hence Socket.IO requires using the Socket.IO libraries on both client and server side.

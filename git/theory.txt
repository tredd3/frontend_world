first checkout a branch and then run the rebase command with the name of the branch you wish to rebase on to:
git checkout feature
git rebase develop/master (provided ur feature branch is cut out from it)

//get current branch name
git branch --show-current

//delete branches
locally: git branch -d <branch_name>
remotely: git push origin -d <branch_name>
both locally and remotely at a time: git branch -D <branch_name>


//revert commits
git log --oneline //to check the commit history
 git reset --soft HEAD~1 - undo the last commit by preserving the changes
 git reset --hard HEAD~1 - undo the last commit and discard all changes in the working directory 

//merging
https://git-scm.com/docs/merge-strategies
lets say u want to override code in master with changes in refactoring_branch
git pull (fetches and merges the remote branches with local branches)
git checkout master
git merge -X theirs <refactoring_branch>

//functional programming
1)Pure functions instead of shared state & side effects- same output for same input all the times
2)Function composition
3)Immutability is a central concept of functional programming
An immutable object is an object that can’t be modified after it’s created
4)HOC(for reusability instead of polymorphism), function composition(instead of inheritance)
5)Declarative rather than imperative code (what to do, rather than how to do it)

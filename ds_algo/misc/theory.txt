//functional programming
1)Pure functions instead of shared state & side effects- same output for same input all the times
2)Function composition
3)Immutability is a central concept of functional programming
An immutable object is an object that can’t be modified after it’s created
4)HOC(for reusability instead of polymorphism), function composition(instead of inheritance)
closures instead of encapsulation
5)Declarative rather than imperative code (what to do, rather than how to do it)
6)In functional programming things are loosely coupled but in OO things are tightly coupled.

HTTP is an application layer network protocol which is built on top of TCP.
HTTPS: It is a combination of SSL/TLS protocol and HTTP.

ordered - we know the order of retrieval is guaranteed - indexed, sorted etc
unordered - order of retrieval is not guaranteed

                  | map             | unordered_map
---------------------------------------------------------
Ordering        | increasing  order   | no ordering
                | (by default)        |

Implementation  | Self balancing BST  | Hash Table
                | like Red-Black Tree |  

search time     | log(n)              | O(1) -> Average 
                |                     | O(n) -> Worst Case

Insertion time  | log(n) + Rebalance  | Same as search
                      
Deletion time   | log(n) + Rebalance  | Same as search

setup: https://jscomplete.com/learn/1rd-reactful

Techstack used in this project:
1)React - for complete frontend (u can add redux and React-router etc for relevant functionalities) 
react - for developing react ui components
react-dom - render react components on both browser and server
2)Express.js as a web and API server
- you can use it to serve static content as well, but its better choose options like NGINX or a CDN service.
3)Webpack - you’ll be writing your code in multiple modules (files) and it will depend on other modules (like React), you need a 
module bundler to translate all these modules into something that can work in all browsers today
4)Babel - webpack is just a generic module bundler. You need to configure it with loaders to transform code from one state into the
 other. For example, you need to transform React’s JSX code into React’s API calls. The tool for that job is Babel. 
 npm i babel-loader @babel/core @babel/node @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react
 The babel-loader package provides the Webpack loader (which you’ll need to configure). The other @babel-scoped libraries are needed to run the Babel configurations for Nodejs and Reactjs.
install babel-cli so that u can use babel command to use/control the babel library from terminal(deployment)
5)mogodb - install mongodb driver(npm i mongodb) to access mongodb from node


Installing Development Dependencies - needed for development purposes
1)Nodemon - When you run a Node server and then change the code of that server, you need to restart Node manually. Nodemon does it for you
2)ESLint is a code quality tool and if you don’t use it, your code will not be as good as it could be.
babel-eslint plugin: if you are using experimental features not supported in ESLint itself yet then use this plugin ou don't have to use it just because you are using Babel
some of the syntax nodes that Babel supports aren't supported by ESLint. When using babel-eslint plugin, ESLint is monkeypatched and your code is transformed into code that ESLint can understand. 
You should use the main recommended ESLint configurations in addition to those recommended for React projects.
make your editor highlight any ESLint issues for you on save.
your editor auto-format code for you on save as well using Prettier. 
3)configure babel, eslint and webpack

//Creating npm Scripts for Development
https://github.com/babel/example-node-server
"scripts": {
    "build": "babel lib -d dist",
    "start": "npm run build && nodemon dist/index.js",
+   "serve": "node dist/index.js"
}

//directory structure
public - folder that will be hosted and served to browser| should contain index.html
src - directory which contains source code | index.js being the entry point
api - all our endpoint code | index.js being the entry point

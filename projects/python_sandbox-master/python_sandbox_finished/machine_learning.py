# high level steps followed
# 1)import data - from csv/db
# 2)clean the data- remove unwanted/ repetettive data
# 3)split the data into training and test sets
# 4)create a model // pick a algorithm based on data, accuracy and other factors
# 5)train a model // by giving training data
# 6)make predictions // by giving test data
# 7)evaluate and improve the predictions by changing params of algorithms/choosing a different algorithm


# libraries for ML:
# Numpy(to work with multi dimensional array)
# Pandas - data analysis - dataframe (2 dimensional data structure with rows and columns)
# matplotlib - graphs and plots
# scikit-learn - famous algorithms like decison tree, neural networks etc


# tools:
# jupyter notebook - easy inspection of data and code
# press tab to get all methods
# press shift+tab - to know about the function

Anaconda Distribution -  Many scientific packages require a specific version of Python to run.
Itâ€™s difficult to keep various Python installations on one computer from interacting and breaking,
and harder to keep them up-to-date. Anaconda Distribution makes management of multiple Python
versions on one computer easier, and provides a large collection of highly optimized,
commonly used data science libraries to get you started faster

//file system - controls how data is stored and retrieved.
/ Without a file system, data placed in a storage medium would 
be one large body of data with no way to tell where one piece of data stops and the next begins
/each group of data is called a "file". The structure and logic rules used to manage the groups of data and their names is called a "file system".
/RAM) is used to create a temporary file system for short-term use.
/different kinds of file systems. Each one has different structure and logic, properties of speed, flexibility, security, size and more
/diff storages: SSD(flash memory),HDD(magnetic storage), optical disks, magnetic tapes
/some files systems are apt for specific storages
local file system, network file system, virtual file system (creating files based on request)

//distributed file system vs local file system (storing images, audio, videos,docs etc)
*client feels that big file that is uploaded is handled by one system but internally that individual
file is being split into blocks and stored in multiple systems
*processing speed is high and time is low since multiple systems are handling the single file
*data replication(atleast 3 replicas) and failure tolerance are taken care by the DFS but 
if u store files in local file system u explicitly need to handle this

//databases are best for data and the file system(storage/hard disk) is best for files.
some pros and cons involved in saving the files in the file system and database.
//Pros of the File system:
*Saving the files and downloading them in the file system is much simpler than database since a simple Save as function will help you out. 
Downloading can be done by addressing an URL with the location of the saved file.
*Migrating the data is an easy process here. You can just copy and paste the folder to your desired destination 
*Easy to migrate it to Cloud storage like Amazon S3 or CDNs etc in the future.
//Cons of the File system: security | hackers can hack into ur system and delete/edit the files but that can be overcome by choosing proper folder structure and permissions
//When is it most preferred: Large files of size more than 5MB and the massive number say thousands of file uploads.   

//Pros of Database: rollback of an update , More Secure than saving in a File System
//Cons of Database: You may have to convert the files to blob in order to store it in db , large files make db heavy, if so many users are accessing 
the same image then we Should not store  it in db.
If you're storing images for a web page then it's best to store them as a file on the server. The web server will very quickly find an image file and
send it to a visitor. Sending files to visitors is the main job of a web server.
If you were to store the same image in a database then the amount of steps to get to this image is greatly increased so the image will be slower 
to download. Also it will use up more server resources. The web server will have to connect to the database and then query the database to get the 
image, download the image from the database and then send the visitor the image
//When is it most preferred:security of the file is the utmost concern like Aadhar, If your application will not demand a large number of files from a large number of users.

//BLOB(binary large object) - collection of binary data stored as a single entity in a database management systems (DBMS). BLOBs are used primarily to hold 
multimedia objects such as images, videos, and sound, though they can also be used to store programs or even fragments of code
*It is a file-like object of immutable, raw data; they can be read as text or binary data, or converted into a ReadableStream 
so its methods can be used for processing the data in phases instead of processing everything at once
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob


//DB indexing : Indexing is a way of sorting a number of records on multiple fields. Creating an index on a field in a table creates another data structure 
which holds the field value, and a pointer to the record it relates to. This index structure is then sorted, allowing Binary Searches to be 
performed on it.

//file paths
./file or <file>  = current directory
../  = the parent directory
../../ = the parent's parent directory 
~/   = the user's home directory
Home directory which is /Users/<short username> (also referred to as ~)
/    = the root directory


//Understanding File Permissions
Every file in linux is owned by somebody and others need permissions
https://www.elated.com/understanding-permissions/#:~:text=drwxr%2Dxr%2Dx,but%20not%20executed%20at%20all.
chmod is the command and system call which is used to set/change the access permissions of file system objects.
You can check the permissions on all files and folders in the current directory by using the command: ls -l
/three types of people that can do stuff to files
1)Owner of the file (creator of the file)
2)Group that the file belongs to
3)Others (everyone else)
in UNIX, these 3 types of people are referred to using the letters U (for Owner, or User), G (for Group), and O (for Others).
/ three basic things that can be done to files or folders(directory):
1)read: file(list the content inside a file): cat command | directory(list the files/folders inside a directory): ls command
2)write: file(edit/delete file content) | directory(create, rename, or delete files within the directory, and modify the directory's attributes)
3)execute: file(run the file) | directory(allows the affected user to enter the directory, and access files and directories inside)
d|r	w	x|r	w	x|r	w	x
  Owner|Group|Other
for rwx (read, write and execute)
    4(r)   2(w)   1(x)
  (2^2)+(2^1)+(2^0)=7  
 similarly for rw- (only read and write) 
   4(r)   2(w)   1(x)
  (2^2)+0+(2^0)=5
 similarly for --x  (only execute)
   4(r)   2(w)   1(x)
  (2^2)+0+(2^0)=5
so rwxrwxrwx is represented as 777
chmod 777 <filename>
chmod 777 -R <directory>
chmod 744 <filename> //read, write and execute for the owner and read only for the group and all others
chmod 755 <filename> //read, write and execute for the owner and only read , execute for the group and all others
d-Directory	r-Read	w-Write	x-Execute
If any of these letters is replaced with a hyphen (-), it means that permission is not granted. For example:

drwxr-x--x
A folder which has read, write and execute permissions for the owner, but only read and execute permissions for the group and 
 only execute permission for other users.
-rw-rw-rw-
A file that can be read and written by anyone, but not executed at all.
-rw-r--r--
A file that can be read and written by the user, but only read by the group and everyone else.


//compressed files
https://www.fosslinux.com/34665/15-tar-command-in-linux-uses-with-examples.htm
tar command is used to create tar archives by converting a group of files into an archive(tarball).
It supports a vast range of compression programs such as gzip, bzip2, lzip, lzma
Gzip is the most popular algorithm for compressing tar files. 
gzip -d file.gz or (gunzip file.gz)
To keep the compressed file pass the -k option to the command:
gzip -dk file.gz
Gzip algorithm is designed to compress only a single file. Files that end in .tar.gz/.tgz are .tar archives compressed with gzip.
tar -tf archive.tar.gz //list the content of a tar.gz file
tar -xf archive.tar.gz //extract the archive in current directory
tar -xf archive.tar.gz -C <directory_path> // extract the archive contents to the given directory
tar -xf archive.tar.gz file1 file2 // extract a specific file(s) from a tar.gz file 
note: When extracting files, you must provide their exact names including the path, as printed by --list (-t)
tar -xf archive.tar.gz --wildcards '*.js' //wildcard formats
tar -xvf archive.tar.gz // print the names of the files being extracted on the terminal

//Unix/Linux file system 
Inodes are a part of the Linux filesystem that store metadata for disk files, including location, size, permissions

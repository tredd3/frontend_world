process:
A program in execution is known as Process
Process memory consists of: stack+heap+data(global and static variables)+text(compiled code)
Thread:

A thread is a path of execution within a process. A process can contain multiple threads.
Multithreading: achieve parallelism by dividing a process into multiple threads
threads within the same process run in a shared memory space, while processes run in separate memory spaces.
Threads are not independent of one another like processes and hence share code section, data section, and OS resources (like open files and signals)
But, like process, a thread has its own program counter (PC), register set, and stack space.
A program counter is a register in a computer processor that contains the address (location) of the instruction being executed at the current time.
paging:
Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory to a process
Logical Address or Virtual Address (represented in bits): An address generated by the CPU
The mapping from virtual to physical address is done by the memory management unit (MMU) which is a hardware device and this mapping is known as paging technique.
CPU scheduler:
It selects a process among the processes that are ready to execute and allocates CPU to one of them.
DEADLOCK:
A process in operating systems uses different resources and uses resources in following way.
1) Requests a resource
2) Use the resource
2) Releases the resource
It can be prevented by avoiding the necessary conditions for deadlock
**Deadlock can arise if following four conditions hold simultaneously (Necessary Conditions): 
Mutual Exclusion: One or more than one resource are non-sharable (Only one process can use at a time) 
Hold and Wait: A process is holding at least one resource and waiting for resources.
No Preemption: A resource cannot be taken from a process unless the process releases the resource.
Circular Wait: A set of processes are waiting for each other in circular form
STARVATION:
High priority processes keep executing and low priority processes are blocked for indefinite time
Resources are continuously utilized by high priority processes
It can be prevented by Aging. In Aging priority of long waiting processes is gradually increased.
kernel: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)
The kernel is a computer program at the core of a computer's operating system with complete control over everything in the system
A kernel is a interface between the applications(browser,audio and video player etc) and hardware of a computer.
2 types of kernels:
Monolithic kernel is a single large process running entirely in a single address space.
In microkernels, the kernel is broken down into separate processes, known as servers.
Some of the servers run in kernel space and some run in user-space.

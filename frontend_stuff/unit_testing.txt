// unit testing for react
* Unit Test:�Tests a function or a component in isolation.
* Integration Test:�Tests a function or component in their context. It should be possible to use it with other function(s) and component(s) in a group.
  Snapshot Test:�Introduced by Facebook�s library Jest,  It creates a DOM snapshot of a component once a test for it runs for the first time and compare this snapshot to a future snapshot, when the test runs again.
Mocha/karma  -  Test runner that runs ur tests
Chai/jamine - assertion library
Sinon - a function has been called with certain arguments or whenever you want to return mocked data from an endpoint.
Jest is not only a testing library for snapshot tests, but also comes with its own test runner and assertion functions.
�Enzyme is only used to render components, access things and simulate events

Why jest?
Easy setup - fast - One-Stop Shop(assertion , mocking(class, functions, timers, modules), test runner , coverage report) - snapshot testing - dynamic testing(watch)

//ADVANCED 5
DEVOPS stages:
1.Version control - source code management	
2.Continous Integration(CI) (Dev mode)- creating a build - after compiling, code review, unit testing(testing each part), integration testing(testing all parts together)
Since everything is automated in devops it is called continuous
JENKINS Is used here
3.Continous Delivery (QA mode)- deploying the build to test servers for UAT
4.Continous Deployment (customer mode) - deploying the build to prod servers
Docker is used here 
Docker image consists of all the project code
Docker container replicates production environment where we can deploy our code and test

//Web server - tomcat, apache, nginix
�When the browser requests the file via HTTP. When the request reaches the correct web server (hardware), the�HTTP server�(software) accepts request, finds the requested document (if it doesn't then a�404�response is returned), and sends it back to the browser, also through HTTP.
static web server - the server sends its hosted files "as-is" to your browser
dynamic web server -  static web server + extra software, most commonly an�application server�and a�database. We call it "dynamic" because the application server updates the hosted files before sending them to your browser via the HTTP server.

//NGINIX - reverse proxy, caching, load balancing
**REVERSE PROXY is a type of proxy server that retrieves resources on behalf of a client from one or more servers. These resources are then returned to the client, 
appearing as if they originated from the proxy server itself.
**CACHING
What is application cache - When a slower external data source is used, frequently accessed data is often moved temporarily to a faster storage that is closer to the application 
Cache is used to reduce the time needed to access data stored outside of the application�s main memory space.
Why cache? - performance, speed, decrease latency , increase throughput and  also  reduce load on the main servers
for how much Time?- configurable
kind of data in  cache - Configuration settings, Reusable results of compute-intensive functions, static content(HTML,JS,CSS), DBMS data(replies to expensive queries from the DBMS),
API responses
An application component uses the API to make requests for service from other components, whether inside (e.g. in a micro-services architecture) or outside the application itself. 
Every request will hit the cache and  the response is served. If the response is not present then main memory servers will be hit, response is stored in the cache and then it is served
Application cache types:

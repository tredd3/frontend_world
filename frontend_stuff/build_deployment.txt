//ADVANCED 5
DEVOPS stages:
1.Version control - source code management	
2.Continous Integration(CI) (Dev mode)- creating a build - after compiling, code review, unit testing(testing each part), integration testing(testing all parts together)
Since everything is automated in devops it is called continuous
JENKINS Is used here
3.Continous Delivery (QA mode)- deploying the build to test servers for UAT
4.Continous Deployment (customer mode) - deploying the build to prod servers
Docker is used here 
Docker image consists of all the project code
Docker container replicates production environment where we can deploy our code and test


//Web server - tomcat, apache, nginix
When the browser requests the file via HTTP. When the request reaches the correct web server (hardware), the HTTP server(software) accepts request, 
finds the requested document (if it doesn't then a�404�response is returned), and sends it back to the browser, also through HTTP.
static web server - the server sends its hosted files "as-is" to your browser
dynamic web server(server side rendering) -  static web server + extra software, most commonly an application server and a database. 
We call it "dynamic" because the application server updates the hosted files before sending them to your browser via the HTTP server.
app server - for api responses 


//NGINIX - reverse proxy, caching, load balancing
**REVERSE PROXY is a type of proxy server that retrieves resources on behalf of a client from one or more servers. 
These resources are then returned to the client, appearing as if they originated from the proxy server itself.
**CACHING
What is application cache - When a slower external data source is used, frequently accessed data is often moved temporarily to a faster storage that is closer to the application 
Cache is used to reduce the time needed to access data stored outside of the application�s main memory space.
Why cache? - performance, speed, decrease latency , increase throughput and  also  reduce load on the main servers
for how much Time?- configurable
kind of data in  cache - Configuration settings, Reusable results of compute-intensive functions, static content(HTML,JS,CSS), DBMS data(replies to expensive queries from the DBMS),
API responses
An application component uses the API to make requests for service from other components, whether inside (e.g. in a micro-services architecture) or outside the application itself. 
Every request will hit the cache and  the response is served. If the response is not present then main memory servers will be hit, response is stored in the cache and then it is served


//why we need proxy or reverse proxy?
*security - no direct access to any of your file transfer servers. Everyone has to pass through the reverse proxy. 
When that happens, you can focus monitoring over what goes in and goes out through the reverse proxy
*single point of access control(gateway) - instead of specifying on every single server what IP addresses 
should be allowed to connect, you can simply create a set of IP access rules on your reverse proxy
*By moving your servers into your internal network and deploying a reverse proxy to control access, 
you can provide better security to those credentials and also sensitive data
*All your servers can be placed in your internal network and they can serve both your internal and external clients.
i.e you can share sensitive information with external partners even without putting the information
 on the DMZ(internet) or granting direct access to your back-end servers to external clients.
*load balancing - uses algorithm like round robin to distribute the load among the servers in the cluster.
*caching - As the cache system of the proxy server is very good, when you access any websites using 
a proxy server, it is having the chance to store your desired data in their cache system.
 And as a result, you can access them whenever you want


//Proxy servers and tunneling 
*A proxy can be on the user's local computer, or anywhere between the user's computer and a destination server on the Internet.
**There are two types of proxies: forward proxies (or tunnel, or gateway) and reverse proxies (used to control and protect access to a server for load-balancing, authentication, decryption or caching).
Forward proxies can hide the identities of clients whereas reverse proxies can hide the identities of servers
**functions of proxy server: 
caching (the cache can be public or private, like the browser cache)
filtering (like an antivirus scan or parental controls)
load balancing (to allow multiple servers to serve the different requests)
authentication (to control access to different resources)
logging (allowing the storage of historical information)
Tunneling - transmits private network data and protocol information through public network by encapsulating the data.
The HTTP protocol specifies a request method called CONNECT
It starts two-way communications with the requested resource and can be used to open a tunnel. This is how a client behind an HTTP proxy can access websites using SSL (i.e. HTTPS, port 443)

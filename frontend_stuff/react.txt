//REACT IMP questions 
why react: declarative(we simply declare what we need and react takes care of implementation), component based, composition(component inside a component)
opp of declarative is imperative 
use: view library mostly used for developing SPAs 
presentational components are concerned with the look
container components are concerned with making things work
features: 
virtual dom(use diffing algorithm to push only the changes to real dom)
Unidirectional data flow - from parent to child
HOC(separate logic from UI)
Supports server-side rendering
JavaScript XML - syntactic sugar for the React.createElement()
four different phases of component lifecycle:
1)Initialization: setting up the initial state and default props
2)Mounting: 
constructor() - initialize state and bind methods
static getDerivedStateFromProps() -It should return an object to update the state, or null to update nothing.
componentWillMount() - unsafe bcoz there is no guarantee that react will call it only once.react can call this method multiple times
render() - only required method in a class component
componentDidMount() -  AJAX requests,event listeners,subsriptions etc
3)Updating: change in state/ change in props/ forceupdate
static getDerivedStateFromProps - It should return an object to update the state, or null to update nothing.
shouldComponentUpdate(prevProps, prevState) - bydefault true, If you are sure that the component doesn't need to render after state or props are updated, you can return false 
PureComponent performs a shallow comparison of props and state | PureComponent+immutable.js for performance
componentWillUpdate() - unsafe bcoz there is no guarantee that react will call it only once.react can call this method multiple times
render() - should be pure,i.e no state updates inside render | renders the contents on virtual DOM
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() - gets the snapshot of DOM before it is updated like capturing scroll position
componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState)
4)Unmounting: componentWillUnmount() - invalidating timers, canceling network requests, or cleaning up any subscriptions
**Error Handling - These methods are called when there is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component.
static getDerivedStateFromError() - This lifecycle is invoked after an error has been thrown by a descendant component.
It receives the error that was thrown as a parameter and should return a value to update state
componentDidCatch() - log information about which component threw the error
Error boundaries are React components that implement one or both the above methods
*setState() does not always immediately update the component. It may batch or defer the update
 this.setState({quantity: 2}) - This form of setState() is also asynchronous, and multiple calls during the same cycle may be batched together.
 If the next state depends on the current state, we recommend using the updater function form, instead:
 this.setState((state) => {
  return {quantity: state.quantity + 1};
});
*forceUpdate() will cause render() to be called on the component, skipping shouldComponentUpdate()
React will still only update the DOM if the markup changes.
*SyntheticEvent, a cross-browser wrapper around the browser’s native event.
SyntheticEvent object will be reused and all properties will be nullified after the event callback 
has been invoked. This is for performance reasons. As such, you cannot access the event in an asynchronous way(like using event object in settimeout)
for using in an asynchronous way, you should call event.persist()
*Fragments - use less memory by not creating an extra DOM node | adding extra divs in the middle of layouts can disturb the layout
*diffing algorithm - time complexity for comparisons - O(n) where n is the number of elements in the tree
diffing algorithm based on two assumptions:
1)Two elements of different types will produce different trees.
React first compares the two root elements:Whenever the root elements have different types, React 
will tear down the old tree and build the new tree from scratch.
if the type is same React looks at the attributes of both, keeps the same underlying DOM node, and only updates the changed attributes
Recursing On Children: React just iterates over both lists of children at the same time and generates a mutation whenever there’s a difference
2)The developer can hint at which child elements may be stable across different renders with a key prop.
using keys eliminate the need of re-rendering of the child elements and simply change their places


//functional vs class components
1)after transpiling by babel less code generated for functional components compared to class
2)easy to read and test as they are plain javascript functions
3)React team mentioned that there may be a performance boost for functional component in future React versions
4)used to write presentational components (focus on the UI rather than behavior)


//hooks
Hooks don’t work inside classes — they let you use React without classes
Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components
Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy - custom hooks
Hooks solve many of problems like sharing stateful logic between components: without forcing you to add more components to the tree
Hooks let us split the code based on what it is doing rather than a lifecycle method name.
React will apply every effect used by the component, in the order they were specified.
useEffect(() => {
  document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
}, [count]); // Only re-run the effect if count changes
If there are multiple items in the array, React will re-run the effect even if just one of them is different.
If you want to run an effect and clean it up only once (on mount and unmount), you can pass an empty array ([]) as a second argument. 
This tells React that your effect doesn’t depend on any values from props or state, so it never needs to re-run. 
Hooks are JavaScript functions, but they impose two additional rules:
1)Only call Hooks at the top level. Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions - allows
 React to correctly preserve the state of Hooks between multiple useState and useEffect calls
If we want to run an effect conditionally, we can put that condition inside our Hook
2)Only call Hooks from React function components. Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions(but u can call Hooks in ur custom hooks)


//inbuilt-hooks
*useState is a Hook sameas this.setState in a class, except it doesn’t merge the old and new state together
*useEffectserves the same purpose as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount in React classes, but unified into a single API.
used to perform side effects from a function component. 
effects - data fetching, subscriptions, logging, timers and manually changing the DOM (can affect other components and can’t be done during rendering)
A function is said to have side effect if it trys to modify anything outside its body. 
By default, React runs the effects after every render — including the first render. 
When exactly does React clean up an effect? React performs the cleanup when the component unmounts.
but effects run for every render and not just once. This is why React also cleans up effects from the previous render before running the effects next time.
*useContext lets you subscribe to React context without introducing nesting
*useReducer lets you manage local state of complex components with a reducer


//AJAX requests should go in the componentDidMount lifecycle method - Doing AJAX in componentDidMount will guarantee that there’s a 
component to update - because you can’t guarantee the AJAX request won’t resolve before the component mounts. If it did, that would
mean that you’d be trying to setState on an unmounted component, which won’t work.
//createElement is what JSX gets compiled to and is what React uses to create React Elements (object representations of some UI).
 cloneElement is used to clone an element and pass it new props.
//Due to the async nature of setState and as react batches the state updates it is not advisable to 
use this.state to get the previous state within setState
use this.setState((prevState, props) => {
  return {counter: prevState.counter + props.step};
})


//Performance in react
class components - shouldComponentUpdate/React.PureComponent
functional components - optimisation given by react future versions and less bundle size(as it transpiles to less code)


//testing in react
1)shallowRenderer as a “place” to render the component you’re testing. This means you can test components isolated from how their children are implemented.
2)snapshot testing by jest 
3)

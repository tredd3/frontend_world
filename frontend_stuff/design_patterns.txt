Each of the design patterns represents a specific type of solution to a specific type of problem
Prototype Design Pattern -  object creation using function and new keyword and resuing prototype properties/methods
modules(IIFE+closures) - we can create objects with private and public parts. These are called�modules
//HOC in react - decorator pattern | DRY | Abstraction or decoupling of logic and UI
Revealing Module Pattern - entire object logic in the private scope of the module and then simply expose the parts we want to be public by returning an anonymous object
Singleton Pattern -  used in scenarios when we need exactly one instance of a class like config object
Observer Pattern - communication between disparate parts of our system// angular MVC
publisher/subscriber promotes even more loose coupling then the observer pattern does. This design pattern is useful in situations when we need to perform multiple operations on a single event being fired.� Instead of using callbacks there is a more elegant way of doing things.
Mediator Pattern - A mediator is an object which is used as a central point for communication between disparate parts of a system and handles the workflow between them. e.g: Redux
Command Pattern - The command pattern is useful in cases when we want to decouple objects executing the commands from objects issuing the commands.
Like separate the objects calling an API service from the objects which are telling them�when�to call the API service.
Facade Pattern - The facade pattern is used when we want to create an abstraction layer between what is shown publicly and what is implemented behind the curtain like query and other libraries interfaces.

Initially we used to use this patterns but now it has been replaced by new stuff like Mediator Pattern  by Redux, Observer Pattern  by Promise, Constructor Pattern by class

what are design patterns - represents a specific type of solution to a specific type of problem
why design patterns? structured code base, reduce output file size , readabilty and maintainabiliy
//anti-patterns - something which we should never do
Polluting the global namespace by defining a large number of variables in the global context
Passing strings rather than functions to either setTimeout or setInterval as this triggers the use of eval() internally.
Modifying the Object class prototype (this is a particularly bad anti-pattern)
document.write - can override entire document content

//types of design patterns
*Creational Design Patterns - solve the problem of object creation controlling the creation process.
e.g: Constructor, Factory, Abstract, Prototype, Singleton and Builder.
*Structural Design Patterns - realize relationships between different objects. They help ensure that when one part of a system 
changes, the entire structure of the system doesn't need to do the same.
e.g:  Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Adapter and Proxy 
*Behavioral Design Patterns -  communication between disparate objects in a system
e.g: Iterator, Mediator, Observer and Visitor


//famous design patterns
Constructor Pattern - reusable object creation logic
Prototype Design Pattern - resuing prototype properties/methods across objects
module pattern(IIFE+closures) - not polluting global namespace, create private variables (closure)
import and export modules
var counter = (function() {
  var privateCounter = 0;
  function changeBy(val) {
    privateCounter += val;
  }
  return {
    increment: function() {
      changeBy(1);
    },
    decrement: function() {
      changeBy(-1);
    },
    value: function() {
      return privateCounter;
    }
  };
})();
console.log(counter.value()); // logs 0
counter.increment();
counter.increment();
console.log(counter.value()); // logs 2
counter.decrement();
console.log(counter.value()); // logs 1
 The lexical environment contains two private items: a variable called privateCounter and a function called changeBy. 
 Neither of these private items can be accessed directly from outside the anonymous function. Instead, they must be 
 accessed by the three public functions that are returned from the anonymous wrapper.
Those three public functions are closures that share the same environment.
//HOC in react - decorator pattern | DRY | Abstraction or decoupling of logic and UI for reuse
Revealing Module Pattern - entire object logic in the private scope of the module and then simply expose the parts we want to be public by returning an anonymous object
Singleton Pattern -  used in scenarios when we need exactly one instance of a class like config object
Observer Pattern - dispatch action and all the reducers are called and not the specific reducer
MVC, MVP, MVVM -  angular MVC
publisher/subscriber - This design pattern is useful in situations when we need to perform multiple operations on a single event being fired.
browser publish events and specific eventlisteners are called.
Mediator Pattern - A mediator is an object which is used as a central point for communication between disparate parts of a system and handles the workflow between them. e.g: Redux
Command Pattern - The command pattern is useful in cases when we want to decouple objects executing the commands from objects issuing the commands.
Like separate the objects calling an API service from the objects which are telling them when to call the API service.
Facade Pattern - functionality is abstracted and we don't have to deal with implementation details e.g: Jquery

//web performance
**less load time
**less rendering time - fast display of content
optimising CRP - prioritize resources (async loading), optimizing the number of requests required along with the file size of each request(use compression and minification), 
less DOM size(lazy loading content/resources on scroll/navigation), load CSS specific to viewport and maintain less specificity
**smooth scrolling

//Use Passive Event Listeners and debounce to Improve Scrolling Performance
*if you attach (scroll - passive by default, wheel, touchstart and touchmove) events to a page, the
browser has to wait to redraw the page until the event listener finishes execution
*document.addEventListener('touchstart', onTouchStart, {passive: true});
*By marking a touch or wheel listener as passive, the developer is promising the handler won't call preventDefault to disable scrolling. 
*The browser can then, for example, keep scrolling at native speed without waiting for your event handlers 
to finish executing , thus ensuring a reliably smooth scrolling experience for the user.

//css 
using media queries makes css non-blocking but the code is downloaded 
best way - load sylesheets corresponding to viewports
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> <!-- blocking -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="print.css" media="print"> <!-- not blocking --> 
<link rel="stylesheet" href="mobile.css" media="screen and (max-width: 480px)"> <!-- not blocking on large screens -->
*browser optimises the animations for below properties on GPU
transform: translateZ(), rotate3d(), etc.), animating transform and opacity, position: fixed, will-change, and filter. Some elements, including <video>, <canvas> and <iframe>,

//js
async/defer 3rd party libraries
Any script tag with type="module" is treated like a JavaScript module and is deferred by default.

//fonts
By default, font requests are delayed until the render tree is constructed, which can result in delayed text rendering.
It is possible to override the default behaviour using <link rel="preload">

//images
sprites - provided images doesn't change so often
use placeholder images and then lazy loading using intersection observer
The loading attribute allows the browser to defer loading of images/iframes that are off-screen until the user scrolls near them.
<img src="image.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="..." />
load images based on viewport
<picture>
    <source srcset="/media/examples/surfer-240-200.jpg"
            media="(min-width: 800px)">
    <img src="/media/examples/painted-hand-298-332.jpg" />
</picture>

//reducing http requests - by caching, Using resource hints, HTTP2
*Using resource hints such as rel=preconnect, rel=dns-prefetch, rel=prefetch, and rel=preload
resource hints like preload and prefetch - parallel loading resources by utilising browser capacity
<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com/" > - helps developers mask DNS resolution latency for cross domain requests
*browser can make 6 parallel connections to a same server

Performance - across devices(mobile, desktop, tablet etc) , networks(LTE, 2g, 3g), users
performance tools -  lighthouse (personalised advice on improving performance, PWA ,SEO ,Best practices and accessibility)
network throttling - simulate diff networking conditions(2g, 3g)
waterfall model -  gives an idea of what is the order of resources downloading and timetaken to download them
profiler - time and memory taken for a js function to execute

PROBLEM 
more code - more data needed and more time to load - Mobile devices have limited CPU power and memory - site unresponsiveness
NEED - retaining users , impacts business and revenues
Frontend performance techniques always depend on the type of application
Images - image optimisation techniques
High computational i.e using complex algo and more fetch calls - web workers
Heavy UI and too much js functionality - routing + code splitting + react virtualisation
for all sites, whose code doesn't change frequently on the server - Caching by browser/ CDN/ service workers
Streaming site - Preconnect + web socket

PROCESS TO RENDER A WEB PAGE I.e  critical rendering path by browser:
1. Process HTML markup and build the DOM tree.
2. Process CSS markup and build the CSSOM tree.
DOM construction is incremental, CSSOM is not. CSS is render blocking: the browser blocks page rendering until it 
receives and processes all of the CSS. CSS is render blocking because rules can be overwritten, so the content can't be rendered until the CSSOM is complete.
3. Combine the DOM and CSSOM into a render tree. (both HTML and CSS are render blocking resources, media queries and types allow us to mark some CSS resources as non-render blocking, The browser downloads all CSS resources, regardless of blocking or non-blocking behavior)
4. Run layout on the render tree to compute geometry of each node and emit paint event once done
Layout - determines size and position of an element on screen
Reduce DOM size and Reduce CSS code and specificity  - to reduce render tree construction and Layout calculation time by browser
5. Paint the individual nodes to the screen.
If either the DOM or CSSOM were modified, you would have to repeat the process in order to figure out which pixels would need to be re-rendered on the screen
layout and paint events are handled by main thread (event loop)

//SOLUTION
LOADING PERFORMANCE  - less visits to site, impacts SEO 
CDN - The goal of the CDN is to reduce latency – the delay between request and response
Network (preload, prefetch - leverage HTTP caching -to eliminate redundant downloads,  preconnect /defer - third party domain, HTTP2)
A preloaded chunk starts loading in parallel to the parent chunk. A prefetched chunk starts after the parent chunk finish
A preloaded chunk has medium priority and instantly downloaded. A prefetched chunk is downloaded in browser idle time.
Use preload for a resource which is guaranteed to be used, prefetch for the resource which has no guarantee to be used.
Preconnect - establishes just a connection  and data flow is not established until your code triggers it.
HTTP 2 - helpfuf for code splitting and preconnect - multiple and simultaneous requests are cheap now
Eliminating Unnecessary Downloads-  ( webpack code on demand - code splitting + prefetch for SPA ), defer , don�u use big libraries to achieve small functionality
Reduce Resource Size ( minification (remove spaces and comments), uglification(shortening variable names) - use source maps for debugging,
				tree shaking - webpack removes unused modules in prod version,
				 image optimisation - sprites, Deliver images responsively ,Configure the  server for compressing resources -images , font-optimisation , DRY - reusable code)
CACHING
http caching - but why? -  reduce load on server - less data usage to client - faster application 
Service worker scriptable cache - V8 uses�just-in-time compilation�(JIT) to execute Javascript code - �When a script is compiled for the first time, cache data is produced and stored and the next time user visits the site The data from cache is served.
Service workers are great for a�progressive web app, which allows for offline access and optimizes for users with poor internet connections.They cache static files


Progressive Web Apps  - push notifications, add to home screen option, update the app at the  time of loading unlike normal apps from play store , caching strategy
https://itnext.io/service-workers-your-first-step-towards-progressive-web-apps-pwa-e4e11d1a2e85
https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/
Service workers  - browser feature - acts as a proxy server - offline working of the APP -event-driven scripts that run independently of web pages �they have access to domain-wide events such as network fetches Service Workers �have scriptable caches are meant to replace the HTML5 Application Cache.

Long-term caching -  avoid having to re-fetch resources that haven't changed -  filename hashing. By webpack
Optimizing the critical rendering path� - achieve higher refresh rates(reduces the amount of time between screen updates after the initial render)
Eliminate render-blocking resources by deferring unused css
 js(parser blocking- rendering engine halts DOM construction until script execution by js engine, JavaScript execution pauses until the CSSOM is ready. also all DOM manipulations like event listeners fail as DOM not constructed)

defer off screen images   -  https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/offscreen-images

//RENDERING PERFORMANCE -, React(virtualisation) , lazyloading , CSS(flexbox) 
Web workers - JavaScript script executed from an HTML page that runs in the background - browser extensions, heavy computations or any thing doesn�t need DOM traversal/access like I/O XHR 	calls, web sockets (live connection), data manipulation(sorting,  filtering  using algorithms), data storing(index db)
they have a different execution environment and hence some default methods and properties of the�window�object can�t be used but most of them including web sockets can be used. Data is sent between workers and the main thread ,using the�postMessage()�method, and respond to messages via the�onmessage�event handler
 (the message is contained within the�Message�event's�data property)
 a single js file can create so many workers and delegate them the work, which they execute parallely. Workers can also create workers and delegate work.

// web storage 
https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/web-storage/
//client side  storage /browser storage are a part of hard disk not RAM. Ur app runs on RAM, so state and props are part of RAM.
structured format(table and rows) - IndexedDB , cookies 
Key/Value - NoSQL databases, Cache API in the browser 
Byte Streams:�This simple model stores data as a variable length - include file systems and cloud storage services
�In private browsing mode, most data storage is not supported
�App cache - which is used to provide offline support is now deprecated and replaced with service workers.
Size 
//local and session storage are 5MB each, indexed DB size is 50MB, each cookie is of 4MB in chrome changes acc to browser.

Web storage APIs - can be sync or async
synchronous� APIs - storage or retrieval requests block the currently active thread until the request is completed - local storage, session storage, cookies 
For efficiency and performance reasons, asynchronous storage APIs are to be preferred - indexedDB, Cache storage API

Cache storage API - ideal for storing resources associated with a known URL.

While�Web Storage�is useful for storing smaller amounts of data, it is less useful for storing larger amounts of structured data. IndexedDB provides a solution.
Combine IndexedDB for storing data offline(application state to be synced with server) with Service Workers for storing assets offline
IndexedDB lets you store and retrieve objects that are indexed with a�key

An�HTTP cookie�(web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server sends to the user's web browser via response headers .
New cookies can also be created via JavaScript using the�Document.cookie�property
The browser may store it and send it back with the next request to the same server.�Typically, it's used to tell if two requests came from the same browser.
Used for Session management, Personalization(themes) , user identification and Tracking user activities
Cookies are sent with every request, so they can worsen performance (especially for mobile data connections)
Session cookie - �deleted when the client shuts down
Permanent cookies - expire at a specific date�
A secure cookie is only sent to the server with an encrypted request over the HTTPS protocol

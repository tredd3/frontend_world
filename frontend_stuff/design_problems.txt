//terminologies
**scalability - handling huge number of requests
1)vertical scalability - increase the current system's computation power, memory, RAM 
time taken to process a request is reduced
single point of failure
inter process communication as there is only server
data consistency
2)horizontal scalability - increase the total number of servers
load balancer is needed
if one of the server fails there are other servers to bank on
network communication b/w servers


//approach


//design whatsapp


//design twiter

//building large applications that can scale
1)client side
web performance - loading + rendering performance
react


2)server side
microservice - decoupling
CDN - caching, reduce latency 
caching - eviction policy needs to be good like LRU and it should have large size else extra call to cache, 
cache invalidation
background sync - update ur cache first and then after every 10sec sync ur updated cache with db in a single request
but keep a list of updated keys so that after 10sec u go and update the data corresponding to keys in ur db
load balancing - distribute load between servers (round robin, weighted round robin, least connections,
weighed least connections, URL Hash and least latency)
Least latency - makes a quick HTTP OPTIONS request to backend servers, and sends the request to the first server to answer
cloud - large computing 
kafka - messaging queue 


3)databases
sharding 
indexing 
in memory data storage - reddis, memcache

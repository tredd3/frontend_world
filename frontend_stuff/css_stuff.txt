Responsive web design - Screen sizes are always changing, so it's important that your site can adapt to any screen size. 
Layout changes based on screen size
Requirements: meta viewport tag, media-queries, mobile first approach
Aspect ratio - the ratio of the width to the height of an image or screen. Landscape - Aspect ratio >1, portrait - Aspect ratio <1
Use css media queries for �rendering the content based on  the display type, width, height, orientation, and even resolution.
Create breakpoints based on content, never on specific devices 
* Use relative sizes for images/content to prevent them from accidentally overflowing the container

//�CSS unit types
1vw is 1% of the width of the viewport.�
1vh is 1% of the height of the viewport.�
1em/1rem = 16px is on the top element. After that 1 em = font size of the nearest parent  and 1 rem = font size of the html element

3 types of pixels:
Css pixels - these change in size with the viewport size . For e.g when we zoom
Density independent pixels(DIPs) - 
Device pixels - fixed hardware fixes

*internet connection 
*DNS lookup in the browser DNS cache. if not found then check in the recursive DNS server(using DNS protocol) maintained by ISP 
and assigned to the browser. If those servers already have the IP address we’re looking for in their cache then we are done.
*if not found our request now travels to what are called the “root name servers”.The root name servers
 are dispersed around the world, and controlled by several separate organizations.
*The root name servers redirect our request to the name servers based on top-level domain (.com or .org)
*The .com name servers will now tell us where to find the authoritative name servers for our specific domain.
*authoritative name servers are the place responsible for delivering information about our domain to the rest of the Internet
ur domain registrar or host provider usually provides this service 
*Then, we head over to the Authoritative Name Servers, who give us the record we’re looking for.
*Finally, the result is cached by the recursive DNS servers, and by our local system - and we load our page!
*“TTL” or time to live setting is simply an amount of time that the name servers will allow records 
to be cached by any of the computers who might store the information about that specific domain
TCP connection 
transfer HTTP message 
server sends the website's files to the browser as a series of small chunks called data packets
so that many different web users can download the same website at the same time. If websites were sent as single big chunks, only one user could download one at a time
browser assembles the small chunks into a complete website and displays it to you

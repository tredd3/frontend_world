//Why companies Acquire other companies?
1)Strategic -  to augument their current businesses(beat competettion/monopoly/forward or backward integration)
2)Diversification - to get into other businesses
3)Investment - purely on a investment basis where companies deploy cash to acquire companies that can generate even more cash


//Reverse merging
merge a smaller company in to a bigger company like ICICI Group merged with ICICI Bank


//Different kinds of acquisition
1)All stock deal:
Acquiring company replaces all the shares of acquired company with its own shares. All the finacial statements of acquired company
  gets merged with the financial statements of acquiring company.
  Acquiring company should make sure this synergy works and net income increases else EPS takes a hit (as the total number of 
  shareholders have now increased)
postive for acquired company shareholders as they don't have to pay tax and also they got shares of acquiring company but in the 
  short term they don't get any cash.
2)All cash deal:
Acquiring company WILL NOT replace all the shares of acquired company with its own shares. Rather it uses cash to buy majority of 
  the shares from the company by fixing price per share.
  Acquired company financial statements will not be merged in to the acquiring company financial statements but they will be part
  of consolidated financial statements.
Acquired company might/might not be delisted based on Acquired company's call. 
  Acquired company shareholders will get cash in exchange for their shares and they have to pay capital gains tax.
  If it gets delisted they will announce a delisting price.
  if it doesn't get delisted and you current minority shareholders don't sell their shares then they will continue as the shareholders
  even after the acquisition
3)Stock + Cash deal: combination of both the above strategies

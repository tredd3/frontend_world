GOLDEN RULE: idea is to hold it forever to get compounding benefit, but in below scenarios we can think of selling securities

-------------------------- WHEN NOT TO SELL --------------------------
Don't sell just because someone told you to do so(do you believe in what they said? did they speak facts/logical guesses or is it a 
 random guess with pure speculation)
Don't sell because the stock crashed by 30%(rather buy more if the fundamentals are strong and story/reason y u bought hasn't changed)
Don't sell because the stock has doubled/tripled (if the stock has strong fundamentals like strong earning growth rate, excellent 
 financials then probably it will become a ten bagger - then y to settle 2 or 3 bagger)


-------------------------- WHEN TO SELL --------------------------
1)If fundamentals gone bad then u need to sell to protect capital even though u might face minor loss
 products not in demand and company focusing on launching new products rather than improving existing ones
2)if fundamentals are good but stock is trading at much higher price than intrinsic value, in such a way that it takes a decade
or more for a company's earnings to match the stock price (i.e price/FCF > 20 compare with FD interest rates (5% interest rate is price/FCF = 20))
so we can sell it and put the money in liquid funds and wait for another bear market
3)Rare Thing: if you find other excellent investments at attractive price
Note: Moreover if you sell u need to pay tax apart from losing a great business
4)if your initial analysis is wrong like u over estimated company growth and under estimated competettion
5)for fast growers like Zomato MOATS are management and promoter. if they exit or resign - unless a promising replacement is found
   and the numbers start improving

//when to sell slow growers
company lost market share
no new products being developed/no R&D spend
acquiring unrelated businesses in the name of diversification
leveraged buyout(acquisition)/paying more for an acquisisition(much greater than intrinsic value) reducing the cash

//when to sell stalwarts
divison contributing highest to revenues is undergoing economic downturn(cigarettes for ITC)
growth rate has become slow and company don't doesn't have any plans to revive growth

//when to sell cyclicals
why did you buy this cyclical? if you have some reason then it is still valid? if NO sell
for example reasons to buy: demand is strong / commodity prices are very low and will increase sooner/no competettior
domestic products to be replaced by low cost imports

//when to sell fast growers
company has already grown so much that it has no room for growth
top executives leaving the company

//when to sell turn arounds
if the company has turned around and public have confidence to buy - now the company probably has already become a multi-bagger
 it might grow some 40-50% but not 5X or 10X.
debt is increasing year on year
inventories rising at twice than sales


//when to sell asset plays
As long as the company is not taking debt that reduces the overall asset value you can hold(you might need very patience)

***** Tax saving instruments *******
Elss + NPS is preferred 
After 3 years Matured ELSS principal will be re-invested in to tax saving and the returns are invested in to equity.
Which means only 1.5*3 yrs = 4.5 lakhs will be invested in to elss  for your whole life for tax saving.
NPS Vs PPF - choose NPS for longterm
Nifty Vs NPS 
Nifty in long term: Compounding advantage > tax advantage
NPS in short term:Tax advantage > compounding advantage

//what is time?
)Time is Allocation - it is a derivation that comes from noting daily time allocation in excel 
  and then observing it carefully

2)Time is Energy - when someone says i don't have time to do it, that means they don't have energy 
  to do it. Energy levels keep changing throughout the day, i.e each and every hour some or the other form of energy will 
  be at high level and some other form is at low level.
4 types of Energy in humans:
/physical energy - sleep(when do u sleep and how long), food, workout
/emotional energy(comes from within) - self confidence, self control, empathy
/mental energy - optimism, creativity, proactive(forward looking)
/spiritual energy - commitment, inegrity, honesty

2 types of tasks - energy increasing, energy decreasing 
how you allocate ur time(or what type of task u do) determines ur energy levels(increases/decreases)
e.g: reading, analysing, brain storming etc will decrease ur energy levels
     sleeping will oncrease ur energy levels
After doing a task whatever energy is left, you should now align the other task according to ur current energy levels:
   do/allocate all important tasks during the day where ur energy levels are highest - now these will mostly be heavy tasks that
      drain ur energy 
   do non urgent and non important tasks in the day where ur energy levels are lowest


3)Time is Money - 
Time is precious , u can spend money and get it back one day or the other but time once spent is gone

//Task handling
Urgent +  Important - you should do it now
Not Urgent +  Not Important - drop it u should never do it
Urgent +  Not Important - delegate it
Not Urgent +  Important - (schedule it) - you should do it later

//what is car leasing
Lease is nothing but car rental with fixed tenure and payment - lease expense includes usage cost, insurance, maintenance etc

//When to opt for lease:
if u want ur car to be frequently replaced with new one
if u don't want down payment and maintenance headaches
if u don't use the car frequently
Best option for those:
who use the car for 1-2 yrs and shift to another place
super best option for businesses - as there is no downpayment balance sheet is not impacted(i.e 
 no cash deduction or loan taken), also lease/rental amount is an expense


//When to buy a car:
if u use the car rigorously - frequent drives
if u want to own the car for next 5-10 yrs and don't want to replace it often
if ur EMI is less than lease amount
if ur family is big and u don't fit in the small car
if u need it at any moment - then it makes sense to own a car


Note: Car leasing business is excellent as it has predictable cashflows along with resale value of the car

//when to hire a car - not lease/buy
when u are alone
u use it less frequently like once a week

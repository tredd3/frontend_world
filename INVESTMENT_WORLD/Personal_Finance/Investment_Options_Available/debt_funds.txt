******* Debt funds ********
//About Debt funds
Debt funds are mutual funds that invest in bonds(govt bonds and corporate bonds )of varying maturity(short term and long term)
Investment period should be equal to bond period else there is a risk
Don’t buy debt funds for any random price 
In short term both debt funds and FDs have similar tax calculations I.e based on the current income slab

Debt funds : Tax efficient in Long Term
e.g: 
Return =7%
Inflation=5%
Long term= After 3 yrs 
U will get indexation benefit, effective return = Return - inflation = 2%
Flat 20% tax irrespective of income slab  on effective return = 2*20% = 0.4%
Final return = 7% - 0.4% = 6.6%

FD: 
e.g:
Return : 7%
No indexation benefit 
Interest Income added to total income and tax based on income slab
For 30% tax bracket people 
Final return = 7% - 30%*7  = 7% - 2.1% = 4.9%

Types of debt funds: 
Liquid funds : short term govt bonds(treasury bills) + short term corporate bonds (commercial paper)
Duration : < 1 yr
Adv: non interest rate risk, capital won’t depreciate, can withdraw anytime
Disadvantage: less returns
Ultra short funds :  medium duration bonds
Long Term debt funds : 
short term govt bonds(GILT) + short term corporate bonds (debentures)
Adv: more returns
Disadvantage:  re-investment and inflation risk, capital depreciation risk in secondary market
PS: avoid investing in long term debt funds rather consider equity.

Risk involved:
1)inflation risk
2)credit/default risk
3)re-investment risk - by the time u get the money prices would have drastically increased
4)interest rate risk - if the bank interest rates keep increasing u will be at loss if u sell the bond in secondary market, as the bond face value decreases to make the yield equal to current bank interest rates
pre-maturity withdrawal risk - if the bank interest rate high than the bond yield no one will buy in secondary market

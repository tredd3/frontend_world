******** MUTUAL FUNDS ********** 
https://www.valueresearchonline.com/funds/
Facts:
Total stock market capitalisation = promoter shares + floating shares
Overall floating shares : DII + FII (60%)
Mutual fund returns are nothing but economy/industry returns
Hence only few mutual funds can give u index beating returns and not all bcoz at the end the aggregate returns of all mutual funds must be equal to economy/industry returns

**** new mutual fund types ******
Feeder fund:
AMC has a master fund in some other country say US and now the indian/foreign subsidary of that AMC 
 raises money in india/foreign country and invests the pooled money in the parent AMC.
They are only allowed to invest in parent AMC and no other fund.
The parent AMC then invests it in direct stocks
Note: you need to pay two expense ratios for both subsidary and parent company

Fund of Fund:
AMC in india collects money and invests in multiple funds in various countries
Note: Here also you need to pay two expense ratios for both subsidary and parent company


******** How to choose the best fund to invest *********
1)Based on time frame:
Short term : 
equity: large cap, bluechip, multicap
debt: overnight, liquid, ultra short and low duration
Hybrid: conservative, ELSS

Medium term - equity funds with majority in large cap
Equity: contra, focused
Debt: banking and PSU debt
Hybrid: dynamic asset/balanced advantage

Long term: 
equity funds - small and mid cap
Debt funds - gilt, corporate bonds, dynamic  bonds and credit risk
Hybrid: aggressive, multi-asset

2)Based on market condition
Bull markets - growth stocks will outperform (growth stocks are generally small cap and have large P/E ratio)
Bear markets - value stocks will outperform bcoz when market retains they will get back their original value (value stocks are generally well established company stocks with low P/E ratio)

*************** Fund analysis and comparison ******************
//analysing individual fund
Direct - growth funds
Consistent performance even though never topped the list
Recent performance should be good
Less standard deviation - less volatile
co-relation(less co-relation b/w asset class more diversification)
R-squared - more correlation with benchmark index is preferred
Alpha - >1 performance better than benchmark index
Beta - <1 less risky/volatile assets
AUM should be high so that tracking error is less
Expense ratio has to be less
Cash component should be less -  more cash less returns
Benchmark - should be acc to category like CRISIL liquid for liquid funds
Exit load should be zero or negligible -  fee that the Asset Management Companies (AMCs) charge investors at the time of exiting or redeeming their fund units
YTM should be high 
YTM means what is the yield/return on a bond if u hold it till maturity
Also u need to check holdings - if there is any such company involved which has negative forecast
Portfolio - should consists of stocks which has great future potential 

//comparison of diff mutual funds
1)Fund performance with market(Sensex/NIFTY) performance
When market is down MF should go lesser than market
When market is up MF should go higher than the market 
2)ratings by CRISIL/ICRA


*************** Types of funds **************
*equity funds - small, mid, large cap | value and growth -risky but more returns in long-term
Contra funds - invest in assets that are either under-performing or depressed at that point in time
I.e they go against most of the investors perception
*bond funds - constant returns - but there is interest rate risk
Dynamic bond - invest in bonds of varying maturities to reduce risk
*index funds - less charges for investor as no analyst/expert advice is needed, get dividends
*Balanced Funds - invest in a hybrid of asset classes to reduce risk exposure
*income funds - provide regular cash flow to investors
*international/global funds - risk diversification
*specialty funds - sector specific like finance, healthcare - high risk - better to avoid unless u have in-depth understanding of the sector
*regional funds - specific region like china, India, Asia etc
*ETFs - Just like MFs but units are traded on stock exchange hence price fluctuates
Daily unlike MF units whose price is decided per day.
Open ended: no locking | can be entered or exited anytime
Close ended: locking period 3-4 yrs | can only apply via NFO

************** Mutual funds investing strategy ******************
If u have no knowledge and don’t want to take any pain on research/analysis - go with index funds

Good Returns for - asset allocation(domestic eq, international eq, debt, gold and commodities) rather than stock selection of individual companies
Reason: diff asset classes perform well at diff times, few years equity, few years gold. 
Even in equity few yrs large cap, few yrs small cap, few yrs mid cap. 

Invest in - previous yr low return asset, diversify the investment + follow business/economy/finance news

//SIP vs Lumpsum
Forecast is Bear market - SIP is preferred so that all ur money isn’t invested when price is high
Forecast is Bull market - Lumpsum is the best bcoz u can get units at lesser price
If u have no idea then go for SIP (dollar cost averaging) - ultimately u will buy at an average price

//direct and regular plans(more expense ratio) are two different channels of investing
//growth and dividend are two profit distribution options
In the growth option, the profit made by the scheme is re-invested in the scheme - compounding effect will be high
In dividend option, the profit made by the scheme, partially or fully paid to the investors

1)portfolio construction - diversification is most important
Index funds are must and Bluechip funds are preferred to be next 
Index funds - Nifty(UTI,ICICI,HDFC) | Nifty next 50 (UTI,ICICI)
Senses vs nifty index funds - nifty represents a broader part of economy
Gilt funds
Bluechip - national reputation, quality, reliable, operates in good and bad times with profit
Contra - Invesco India Contra Fund
Large cap - Mirae Asset Large Cap Fund Direct Growth
mid cap - https://groww.in/mutual-funds/mirae-asset-emerging-bluechip-fund-direct-growth
Multi cap
small cap


2)Every month plan (SIP) - 10,000/month
Every year increase ur monthly SIP  by at least 10%(or rate at which ur salary increases)
Note: invest more amount when markets have crashed - so tracking markets is must 
Choose the best exit time or keep it for 5+yrs

3)price(market price) vs value(intrinsic value from the company)
share/MF unit market price >  share/unit value - sell them
share/MF unit market price <  share/unit value - buy them
share/MF unit market price =  share/unit value - hold them if u r confident on the company/industry future
Also when markets are down  - buying is the best
When markets are up - selling is the best



************** Mutual Funds Exit strategy ******************
In the below scenarios it is better to exit from MFs
-MOST IMPORTANT: MF cannot beat the index for past 3yrs
-NEXT: MF cannot beat the peers for past 3yrs
-if INR becoming stronger compared to USD
-investment objective is not met like sector is not attractive anymore
-if you find an oppurtunity which can give better returns than the current MF
-near the retirement - systematic withdrawl plan(withdraw certain amount every month/year)
-for rebalancing debt and equity allocation

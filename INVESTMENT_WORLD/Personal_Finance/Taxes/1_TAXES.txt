*************** BASICS *****************
//HUF
similar to having extra member in a family - All the income tax benefits, deductions apply in the same manner as individuals
we can set up one HUF per family
one member can be part of 2 HUFs - his own with his spouse and kids and another with his parents
HUF has a separate PAN
HUF once formed can't be dissolved
All Income In HUF belongs to everyone in the family
When to form an HUF and take tax advantage:
1)Lot of income from other sources and all family members are already under 30% Tax bracket
In this case we can't have assets under their name as there will be no tax benefit
2)Parental property sale and don't know whose PAN to use
3)Family Business can be registered under HUF
4)Family Investments can be made in the name of HUF like physical and Financial assets 
5)Estate Planning: HUF can be used as an effective tool for estate planning and wealth transfer within the family. 
Assets can be transferred to the HUF, and subsequent income earned from those assets can be taxed at potentially lower rates 
compared to individual tax rates.

3)Rebate: As an incentive Govt tells us not to pay certain amount of outstanding tax then it is tax rebate

------------- Payment of Tax Liability -------------
1)TDS (tax deduction at source)
TDS is the tax deducted by the payer (also known as the deductor) from the income of the payee (also known as the deductee) 
at the time of making certain payments such as salary, interest, rent, commission, professional fees, etc.
2)TCS (tax collection at source)
TCS is the tax collected by the seller from the buyer at the time of sale of certain specified goods or services.
3)Advance Tax - Govt needs this for maintaing day to day operations and timely salary payment to Govt employees
In case TDS is not deducted like rental income , capital gains, business income, then we need to pay Advance tax by certain due dates
Or out of Total tax liability , only part of it is TDS then rest has to be paid as Advance tax
So basically we need to extrapolate the tax for the whole year and pay as below: 
You as an individual are required to pay 15% of the total annual tax tax for that financial year 
by 15th June, 45% by 15th Sept, 75% by 15th Dec, and 100% by 15th March. 
Not paying would entail a penalty of annualized interest of around 12% for the period by which it was delayed.
4)Self Asessment Tax
Tax paid to Govt while filing IT returns (ideally this is the tax that you are supposed to pay as advance tax in the previous FY)
4)Regular Asessment Tax 
after ITR is processed , additional tax you need to pay is called Regular Asessment Tax 
5)Interest to be paid due to below reasons: 1% per month
delayed ITR filing
delay in payment of advance tax - 3% interest on unpaid amount
non payment of advance tax - 4% interest on unpaid amount
    you must pay at least 90% of the total taxes as advance tax by 31st March. Failure to make advance tax payments will result in 
    an interest @ 1% per month on the unpaid amount (so from April to july , i.e ITR filing month - there are 4 months * 1% =4%)
claimimg excess refund
assesse in default

------------- ITR filing -------------
Late ITR filing fees (even if the delay is 1 day) :
gross total < 2.5 lakhs  - NIL (as there is no need to file ITR)
gross total > 2.5 lakhs and net total income < 5 Lakhs  - 1000 (but need to file ITR)
> 5 Lakhs net total income - 5000 (obviously need to file ITR)

//ITRs Types
Regular return : ITR filed before due date (Timeline for Regular Return is July 31st)
Belated Return : ITR filed after due date
Revised Return : if Regular/Belated Return is filed and you think that something is missing then you can file Revised Return
Timeline for Revised Return is Dec 31st

ITR 2: When you have other sources of income including capital gains or just capital gains
ITR 3: When you have business income (Intraday , F&O) or professional income and capital gains 


*************** STOCKS TAXATION *****************
tax on the sale of shares (capital gains tax) in India is not automatically deducted by the broker at the time of the sale. 
Investors are generally responsible for calculating and paying their capital gains tax as per the applicable tax laws.
Net P&L = Gross P&L - charges
Net P&L(for tax purpose) = Gross P&L - charges + STT 
except STT(securities transaction tax) every other charges can be included in charges while calculating Net P&L while filing ITR
Since STT is paid to Govt, we can't claim it as expense

Here's a brief overview of how capital gains tax works for shares in India:
1) Short-Term Capital Gains (STCG): If you sell shares within one year of purchase, the gains are considered short-term. 
Short-term capital gains on equity shares are taxed at a higher rate. As of 2023 it is 15%

//Tips to Reduce the Burden of STCG on Shares
i)Individuals can adjust their short-term capital loss on shares against other short-term or long-term capital gains. 
However, individuals should refrain from going overboard with this particular tax-saving strategy.

ii)Individuals may carry forward their losses as a tax adjustment. Individuals are allowed to carry forward such losses for up 
to 8 financial years.

2) Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG): If you sell shares after holding them for more than one year, the gains are considered long-term.
 As of 2023, LTCG on equity shares exceeding Rs. 1 lakh is taxed at 10%, without the benefit of indexation.

//Note:
1)Tax Audit if equity transactions exceed 2cr per FY per per account
2)If the transactions (buy/sells) are executed through off-market transfer where shares are transferred from one person to another 
via delivery instruction booklet and not via a recognized exchange by paying STT
then LTCG is 20% in case of both listed and non-listed stocks (Listed are those which trade on recognized exchanges). 
Also STCG is as per slab rate
In both cases STT is not paid, but you end up paying higher capital gains tax.
3)Note that a gift from a relative through DIS slip is not considered as a transaction and hence not capital gain. 
It is important that gift not be treated as transfer, and relative could be (i) spouse of the individual (ii) brother or 
sister of the individual (iii) brother or sister of the spouse of the individual(iv) brother or sister of either of the 
parents of the individual (v) any lineal ascendant or descendant of the individual(vi) any lineal ascendant or descendant
 of the spouse of the individual (vii) spouse of the person referred to in clauses (ii) to (vi)


********** REAL Estate Taxation **********
X Gifts property to Y after holding for 10 yrs, but Y sold this asset in just 45 days
then LTCG will be applicable as holding period is considered to be 10 yrs + 45 days
similarly, cost of acquisition is also equal to cost of acquistion  by X 


********** CAPITAL GAINS Taxation **********
//Capital asset : every asset is a capital except except the below
Rural agriculture land
personal effect (mobile, watch, laptop , vehicle etc)
Goods for sale
gold monetization bonds

//Capital Gain comes in picture when Capital asset is transferred (sales/exchange/extinguishment)
extinguishment - govt taking land giving money
--Exempt transfer (wehere capital gains is not applicable)
Bonus issue of a share by a company
Gift/Will
HUF partition
Amalgamation/Demerger
Firm to Company conversion

//Capital Gain Formula
Short term capital gains = sales - cost related to transfer(brokerage) - cost of acquisition - cost of improvement
Long term capital gains = sales - cost related to transfer(brokerage) - cost of acquisition - cost of improvement
Note: 
for few capital assets like Real estate, Gold there is indexation benefit in longterm i.e cost of acquisition inflation adjusted
i.e govt says we want to tax real returns (nominal returns - inflation) not nominal returns from a capital asset


********** GIFT Taxation **********
Gift from relatives is exempt: Relatives include spouse, bother, sister, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, 
brother or sister of either of the parents, lineal ascendant or lineal descendant of individual or spouse
any Gift including - shares, real estate , gold, cash etc
At a time cash transferred should be less than 2 lakhs to be on safer side 
from non-relatives : only on occassion of marriage, Gifts are exempted


********** Clubbing of Income **********
Transferred money or asset to Spouse, Minor, HUF and the returns made on the asset/money is taxed at the hands of the transferred
So instead of transferring it to Spouse/HUF directly, we should tranfer it via relatives as mentioned above - to save tax
Note: Money/Asset transferred to spouse is not taxable as it is a Gift, but returns made via asset is taxable
DONT Transfer anything to Minor, as it is taxable in the hands of parents irrespective of who transferred it


***************** Tax saving and Compliances ******************
Brahmastra : Gift/Will has ZERO tax 
but when the capital asset is recieved as a gift from non-relatives , Gift reciever should pay the tax (unless he recieved it for his marriage)
1)Capital gain harvesting : sell 1 lakh worth shares in every portfolio and buy the next day, i.e per portfolio 10k tax can be saved in 1 yr
2)Capital loss harvesting: Offsetting capital losses with Capital gains
losses can be carry forwarded to 8 years and can be setoff with capital gains in future
STCL can setoff STCG and LTCG
LTCL can only setoff LTCG
3)Indexation benefits for few asset classes
4)Take Loan on Assets instead of selling the Assets
5)Exemption: Basic exemption limit of 3 lakhs applicable for STCG nad LTCG (useful for those with no salary income)
6)Ancestral property acquistion date unknown - then it is considered to be april 1, 2001
7)Re-invest the gains
urban agri land sold and reinvest the money in to another urban agri land - no capital gains tax
residential property sold (section 54) and reinvest the money in to another residential property within 2 years 
sale of any longterm capital asset and put the proceeds in to bonds or ELSS or resendential real-estate (section 54EC and section 54F) 
As per section 54F of IT act:
The taxpayer should utilize the net consideration from the sale of the original asset to purchase or construct a residential house.
The new residential house must be purchased one year before or two years after the date of transfer of the original asset. 
In the case of construction, it should be completed within three years from the date of transfer.
The taxpayer should not own more than one residential house on the date of transfer of the original asset.
i.e The exemption is available even if the taxpayer already owns a single (but not more than) residential house other than the new one 
Tip: once via Stocks/Gold is transferred via Gift -> sell and re-invest that money in real estate in the area which you reside, 
then stay in that house and pay rent to the person (father/mother) -> you can claim HRA, but they need to disclose it as an income for 
your parents ITR -> then use HUF for other family Investments

Tip:  Gift shares to those who don't have house under their name and the beneficiary can reddem it and buy house on his/her name
Exemption for Relatives: If you transfer shares as a gift to specified relatives (like parents, spouse, siblings, and children), 
it is typically exempt from gift tax.
While not mandatory, it is advisable to have a gift deed documenting the transfer of shares. This can serve as proof of the transaction and the intent behind it.

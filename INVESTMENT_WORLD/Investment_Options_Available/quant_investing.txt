Quant investing is all about predictive Analysis and timing the market(entry and exit) using data and with least human intervention
You predict in which sector, stock , theme , markets - (China, India, US) you have an opportunity 
  Of getting high returns
You feed all params and data in to the system and system gives you recommendation based on 
The VRLT framework

Fundamental analysis - what to buy and why to buy
Technical analysis - when to buy
 
 
//VRLT framework
V - Valuation (Tells you till what point can your asset/stock rally) - 1/3rd focus
R - Risk
   low risk : Money flows in low PE/beta stocks, Gold, Debt
   High risk : Money flows in high PE/beta stocks, crypto, loss making companies, using leverage to invest
L - Liquidity (moment of domestic and international money across asset classes) - 2/3rd focus
   from RBI -> Banks -> public(individuals, institutions) -> spend + invest (various asset classes
   like real estate, gold, equities, debt, crypto etc) <- international inflows 
T - Timing (i.e buy/sell based on liquidity inflow/outflow and risk not based on Valuation)

//In india scenario: 
Quant funds started since last 3 yrs - so we need to wait till 2025 to check their consistency
Churnout ratio is high - but this is true for any quant fund in the world

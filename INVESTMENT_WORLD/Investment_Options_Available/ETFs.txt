********* Index funds vs ETFs ************
Both are same from investment perspective
But Index funds are preferred.

Index funds :
units are bought from  MF houses - no liquidity issues
No need to have trading and demat account
Expense ratio may be more compared to ETFs
SIPs are easy by providing mandates
No transaction charges
Issue: Buy/sell only at NAV of closing day if bought before 3pm else next day closing NAV

ETFs:
Bought from exchange - There can be iquidity issues if there are no sellers/buyers
Must have a trading and demat account
SIPs need to done actively no mandates allowed
Transaction charges are levied by broker as buy/sell happens on exchanges
Adv: But/sell at market price

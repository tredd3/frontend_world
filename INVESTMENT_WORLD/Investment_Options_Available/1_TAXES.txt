*************** STOCKS TAXATION *****************
tax on the sale of shares (capital gains tax) in India is not automatically deducted by the broker at the time of the sale. 
Investors are generally responsible for calculating and paying their capital gains tax as per the applicable tax laws.

Here's a brief overview of how capital gains tax works for shares in India:
1) Short-Term Capital Gains (STCG): If you sell shares within one year of purchase, the gains are considered short-term. 
Short-term capital gains on equity shares are taxed at a higher rate. As of 2023 it is 15%

//Tips to Reduce the Burden of STCG on Shares
i)Individuals can adjust their short-term capital loss on shares against other short-term or long-term capital gains. 
However, individuals should refrain from going overboard with this particular tax-saving strategy.

ii)Individuals may carry forward their losses as a tax adjustment. Individuals are allowed to carry forward such losses for up 
to 8 financial years.

2) Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG): If you sell shares after holding them for more than one year, the gains are considered long-term.
 As of 2023, LTCG on equity shares exceeding Rs. 1 lakh is taxed at 10%, without the benefit of indexation.

As per section 54F of IT act:
The taxpayer should utilize the net consideration from the sale of the original asset to purchase or construct a residential house.
The new residential house must be purchased one year before or two years after the date of transfer of the original asset. 
In the case of construction, it should be completed within three years from the date of transfer.
The taxpayer should not own more than one residential house (in addition to the new one) on the date of transfer of the original asset.
i.e The exemption is available even if the taxpayer already owns a single (but not more than) residential house other than the new one 

Tip:  Gift shares to those who don't have house under their name and the beneficiary can reddem it and buy house on his/her name
Exemption for Relatives: If you transfer shares as a gift to specified relatives (like parents, spouse, siblings, and children), 
it is typically exempt from gift tax.
While not mandatory, it is advisable to have a gift deed documenting the transfer of shares. This can serve as proof of the transaction and the intent behind it.

  legal orders(confirm from wiki) and tickertape
  corporate actions, dividend history and announcements from tickertape
  check shareholding pattern(especially promoter) trend over the years in tijori
  promoter pledging

  can a fool run this business
  can you put 25% of your net worth, buy the whole business and forget about it for next 5-10 yrs ???
  for longterm : don't invest in a stock just bcoz the stock price will increase, invest because you want to own that business

Finance check:
  //Balance sheet
--Total assets(current valuation) compared with Marketcap - to identify asset plays
--check current assets(mainly cash) compared to current liabilities - bcoz if current liabilities > current assets then u need to 
  sell non current-assets to clear them or take loan (both are bad)
--shareholder Equity growth should be due to retained earnings growth and not new common stock(check cashlow statement - financing 
  activity -- proceeds from shares section)
  //Profit and loss statement
--sales growth consistent and increasing?
--operating profit +ve  most of the time and growing?
--other income significant to operating profit over the years?
--interest expense >40-50% of operating profit?
--net income consistently +ve and growing? 
//Cashflow statement
--CFO +ve most of the time and growing?
--free cash flow consistently +ve and growing?
Note: if free cash flow is -ve check why
free cash flow -ve bcoz of operating cash flow => company is bad and in-efficienct
free cash flow -ve bcoz of capex => is it doing continous capex(10 yr check cash flow analysis)
--use of freecash flow: check 10yr cash flow analysis in tijori (preferrence is reinvestment)
//Profitability Ratios Check:
--NPM(consistent and above 10%) - company has Pricing power 
--OPM(consistent and above 10%) - company has Efficient management 
--ROE consistent and  10-15% (with D/E under control)? ROE is the real return as this indicates that owners wealth is being compounded 
--ROCE(consistent and above 15%) - good profitability
--ROIC(consistent and above 15%) - company has MOATS
--D/E < 1?
if D/E > 0 check in the balance sheet if the long term debt is increasing ?
check D/E trend
can long term debt can be cleared by earnings of 4 yrs?(look at debt/Profit metrics in screener)

any research report/youtube analysis available for the company: 
what peter lynch bucket does stock belongs to : slow growers/stalwarts/fast growers/cyclicals/asset heavy/turover(special situation)


--------------------- PRESENT --------------------
---Sectoral analysis:
//STAGE of development:
pioneering - EV, green energy
growth - internet
maturity/saturation - FMCG
declining - obselete - TV channels, print media
//Sector value chain : from sourcing to sales entire process and businesses involved must be known (you should always pick companies 
at profitable end of value chain), demand and supply (size of opportunity)
//Market size/Oppurtunity or possible demand for the Sector: it is not about how big a company is, it is about how big a company can get
   only within the country :
        limited to few businesses/limited customer usage
        not limited to a single user (almost every user will find its usage now or eventually)
        not limited to single business (almost every business will find its usage now or eventually)
   global oppurtunity/exports :
        limited to few businesses/limited customer usage
        not limited to a single user (almost every user will find its usage now or eventually)
        not limited to single business (almost every business will find its usage now or eventually)

---Products/services DEMAND check :
//From where does the actual demand from for the company? 
  B2B (client diversification, strong order book - must be volume led growth)
  B2C (how many users out of 140 cr population use it)
  Business service companies (what all industries/companies need it)
  Government
  Global - from which all countries demand come from

//Type of demand
    Infrastructure/Platform - repeat usage including subscripton models
    continous and growing demand - volume led growth reaching to larger audience or more consumption(personal care, healthcare, 
       insurnace, real estate, home furnishing, Energy,Banking and finance)
    continous and replacement/upgradation demand based on latest trends/depreciation - value addition (clothing and footwear, 
        Electronics, Automobile, Telecommunication)
    continous and constant/slow growth demand(FMCG, Food)
    one time demand(capital goods) then growth oppurtunities size should be vast like Praj.Even though Praj establishes the ethanol
     plant, it has huge oppurtunity abroad/huge order backlog both domestic and abroad
    Transition Demand - EV, Renewable Energy, 5G, New Technology - need a lot of research as it can make or break your portfolio

//Capturing sector demand Oppurtunities:
sector demand is growing like Telecom, aviation : even if the company retains its market share and can sustain over the years 
  it can grow effortlessly
sector demand constant like FMCG :  company needs to capture market share from others by providing unique products or enetring in to 
   other FMCG verticals where the company is not even present


---Products/services SUPPLY check :
1)Product portfolio - what all products company manufactures (you can find in investor presentation) - check revenue contribution 
  of each product

2)COMPETETION :  Never look for companies that doesn't have competetion, always prefer companies that sustained competettion with their 
             MOATS bcoz someday or the other competettion is bound to come if it is a high margin business. At the same time Never 
             invest in a business that is present in a highly competettive industry that competes ONLY on price instead of value
  what is the unlisted players market share - 
  listed peers market share -
  postion among peers - 
  global competettion - imports risk from china or any other low cost producer country?
  threat of new entrants

3)Listed peers Comparison: tijori(benchmark) and screener peer comparison sections for profitability and costs

4)Products/services Uniqueness and Quality check :
what makes the product or service of this company Unique?
  //does it delight the customers - when they don't find that product in a store will they go across the street to get it
  //does it own consumers mind(i.e people always remember this company when u talk about a specific product like drink,burger,choc etc)
  //what value does it add to customers compared to competetiors?
  //how is the quality of product/service - Have u used the product/service ? 
    if YES, what is your view 
    if NO, go and open their website, check public review in ecommerce or google search


------------------- FUTURE -----------------
---Goal/Aim that the company wants to achieve and what is the Strategy that it wants to employ?
//Goal/Aim - global leader, capture market share from unorganised players, cleanup stuff and become efficient etc
//Strategies being employed: 
ideally a company that clones other successful strategies is almost bound to win provided it has other necessary qualifications


--- EARNING POWER (Earnings Growth Oppurtunities check )
//SOURCE OF EARNINGS
--Internal Growth oppurtunities 
monetising sharing viewers per subscriber
introducing subscription with ads - giving the service at lesser price for users who need it
focus on games and animated series - creating more value for money paid by subscribers
sports documentaries
orginal content acquisition - by collaboration of the ground team with producers

--External Growth oppurtunities
Macroeconomic :
 focus on Indian content and subscribers by reducing prices and giving quality content
Tailwinds

---- Sustainability of Earning power: MOATS and Pricing Power to make it a long term bet
1)Competettive advantage/MOAT Check?
Economises of Scale - demand side
Brand
Network effect - more production houses in the world collarborate with Netflix


2)PRICING POWER (MUST HAVE MOAT)
IF NO?  what can be done to counter the absence of pricing power?
  --Hence backward integration or having long term contracts will be a plus to maintain predictability
  --Significant volume increase - and become a low cost producer (market share)
  --maintain low debt - incase international prices drops significantly they don't have a choice but to decrease the price for not 
  losing business , even though their costs have increased and should be in a position to take debt if required
  --achieve operating efficiency so that operating cost is less

3) Longterm vs short term bet
/Preferred Investment: Both MOATS and Earnings Growth oppurtunities need to exist for sustainable Earnings
/Company with No Moats  but very high growth oppurtunities - a short term buy becuase other competetiors with MOATS can take away the
market share soon - need to monitor closely
/Company with good MOATS but not very good growth oppurtunities - it has become a slow grower(if they genrate a stable free cashflow
you can use the cash to buy other growth and non-growth businesses) 
Note: Don't forget to compare dividend yield with FD interest rates


----Capital Allocation 
//SOURCE OF CAPITAL - Debt/Retained Earnings/New Equity


//USE OF NEW/INCREMENTAL CAPITAL : A good company always uses capital for progressing and next phase growth and not for survival 
Cash
Organic growth - putting back the money in the same business
Inorganic growth - M&A
Dividends
Buyback - preferred
Capex - new
Capex - old PLANT/MACHINERY maintainance (this can't be for ever year meaning sustainence capex is bad for the company)
modernising or technology upgradation of operations
R&D
Advertising
Working capital (tied up in) - bad


//RETURN ON CAPITAL
Good company: ROCE/ROIC(return on capital) > WACC (cost of cpital)
Very Good company: ROCE/ROIC(return on capital) >>> WACC (cost of cpital)
Ideal company : if it can redeploy the incremental capital for same/high returns over time - it becomes a compounding machine

// SUMMARY (Business Quality Check) - decided by PAST, PRESENT and FUTURE of the company
  -Predictable and consistent/recurring EARNINGS for next 10 yrs(MOATS, pricing power)
  -Competes on value rather than price bcoz company that competes on value is like a magnet with stronger magnetic field  that
    attracts customers and companies which compete on price will lose their business to competetiors
  -prefer high margin non commoditized business - if commoditized then must be a low cost producer
  -lousy industry/highly competettive industry/niche industry(no big players have entered yet) ?
  -proxy play on some capital intensive/debt heavy/lousy industry ? 
  -Superior economics (what does company produce, target audience and how does it produce): ESG Principles
   Environmental: does the process/products cause any kind of pollution
   Social: does the products/services add some value to customers or do they waste their time or money or destroy their health
   Governance: Superior Management and board of directors
  -Scalable business model - globally preferred (mutibagger are made because of this property)
  -Company having calibre or potential to adapt to the changing business environment - having said that invest 
    in a business with slow rate of change, rapid change is the enemy of an investor as it needs more capital to adapt and 
    burns more cash to be in the competettion)
  -Having Tailwinds is an added advantage as it boosts the process of wealth creation and helps u in achieving goal faster

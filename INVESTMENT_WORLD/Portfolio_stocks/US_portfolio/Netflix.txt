  can a fool run this business
  can you put 50% of your net worth, buy the whole business and forget about it for next 5-10 yrs ???
   assuming that stock market is closed for next 5-10yrs are you ok holding the entire business without knowing its price every year?
  for longterm : don't invest in a stock just bcoz the stock price will increase, invest because you want to own that business

//Finance check:
1)Balance sheet Strength check
--Equity/Total assets (liabilities should be as less as possible for a strong balance sheet): 33%
--(Price to book value) - 17 (not an asset play)

//non-current assets - 36
-intangible assets : 30
-long term investments : 4

//Net current assets - 0

//shareholder Equity - 15
--Check Equity CAGR from balance sheet equity section 
   equity is increasing and ROE is also increasing
--Sorce of Equity increase: to find this out balance sheet should be studied in tally with cash flow statement
 Sustainable:  cash flow from operations(goes in to retained earnings) since last 2 yrs

//non-current Liabilities - 20


2)Profit and loss statement: Good
  
3)Cashflow statement: company started generating positive cashflow from last 2 yrs
-- if debt is increasing u need to check the usage of debt in investment section or is to cover Operating loses?
first 3 yrs it was to cover operating losses, but for last 2 yrs it was used for capex(studios) and debt was used to 
  repay previous debt(refinancing), cash acquisition and stock buyback (all are good usage of debt, but could have been better)

4)Profitability Ratios Check:
--GPM 41%
--OPM 21%
--NPM from 7% to 17%
Note: if NPM is less then check Asset turnover ratio, if both are less than ROE is less and you need to avoid that business
--ROE increased from 27% to 38%
--ROCE increased from 6% to 17%
--check D/E , Note: it's not about how much debt the company has taken, it's about the repaying capacity
if D/E > 0:
-ve CCC and Interest coverage ratio improving
check in the balance sheet if the debt is a short term one or longterm one (it must be longterm)
long term debt but stagnant over last 3 yrs
  Total debt: 15B
  Cash: 6B
  operating profits/operating cashflow: 1 B

--------------------------- BUSINESS STRENGTH CHECK ---------------------------
Investor presentation for reference: 
-------------------- PAST --------------------
know about the company:
  Nature of business: consumer services
  What does it do: (what is the actual business): 
   Netflix is one of the world's leading entertainment services with 222 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying 
   TV series, documentaries, feature films and mobile games across a wide variety of genres and languages
  How does it do :
    Not a generic video company - Netflix is a subscription-based streaming service that allows members to watch TV shows
       and movies without commercials on an internet-connected device. 
    Competitive pressures in bidding for content would lead us to have slightly less content than we would otherwise, rather than overspending
    Netflix is well positioned to bring engaging stories from many cultures to people all across the globe.
    personalised recommendations based on what users love to keep them engaged
    Offline downloads available on the Netflix app
    lot of investment on fresh and original content
    80% of Netflix users stream content suggested by its personalized recommendation algorithm
  Subsidaries/JVs :
  Target Audience : all Adults and entertainment lovers
  market size: huge
  market share: 50% (doesn't make sense because it is not a zero sum game industry)
  Presence : Netflix is available virtually everywhere except in China.
  Globally competetive company: Yes
  REVENUE GEOGRAPHY: US 43%, EMEA 31%, LATAM 13%, APAC 9.6%, CANADA 2.6% 
  Revenue Model: 
    flat-fee (subscription-based)
promoters:
why did the promoters start the business: to capture the huge oppurtunity insome industry/sector OR passion
any research report/youtube analysis available for the company: 
what peter lynch bucket does stock belongs to : slow growers/stalwarts/fast growers/cyclicals/asset heavy/turover(special situation)


--------------------- PRESENT --------------------
---Sectoral analysis:


//STAGE of development: growth - internet
//Sector value chain : netflix is the producer/someone else is => directors direct the shows /films and produce content => goes 
  in to Netflix library => users consume it
//Market size/Oppurtunity or possible demand for the Sector: it is not about how big a company is, it is about how big a company can get
   only within the country :
        limited to few businesses/limited customer usage
        not limited to a single user (almost every user will find its usage now or eventually)
        not limited to single business (almost every business will find its usage now or eventually)
   global oppurtunity/exports :
        limited to few businesses/limited customer usage
        not limited to a single user (almost every user will find its usage now or eventually)
        not limited to single business (almost every business will find its usage now or eventually)

---Products/services DEMAND check :
//From where does the actual demand from for the company? 
  B2B (client diversification, strong order book - must be volume led growth)
  B2C (how many users out of 140 cr population use it)
  Business service companies (what all industries/companies need it)
  Government
  Global - from which all countries demand come from

//Type of demand
    Infrastructure/Platform - repeat usage including subscripton models
    continous and growing demand - volume led growth reaching to larger audience or more consumption(personal care, healthcare, 
       insurnace, real estate, home furnishing, Energy,Banking and finance)
    continous and replacement/upgradation demand based on latest trends/depreciation - value addition (clothing and footwear, 
        Electronics, Automobile, Telecommunication)
    continous and constant/slow growth demand(FMCG, Food)
    one time demand(capital goods) then growth oppurtunities size should be vast like Praj.Even though Praj establishes the ethanol
     plant, it has huge oppurtunity abroad/huge order backlog both domestic and abroad
    Transition Demand - EV, Renewable Energy, 5G, New Technology - need a lot of research as it can make or break your portfolio

//Capturing sector demand Oppurtunities:
sector demand is growing like Telecom, aviation : even if the company retains its market share and can sustain over the years 
  it can grow effortlessly
sector demand constant like FMCG :  company needs to capture market share from others by providing unique products or enetring in to 
   other FMCG verticals where the company is not even present


---Products/services SUPPLY check :
1)Product portfolio - what all products company manufactures (you can find in investor presentation) - check revenue contribution 
  of each product

2)COMPETETION :  
  Because the entertainment market is so broad, multiple firms can be successful bcoz of different exclusive content.
  licensed content the game is played on price - bcoz a competetior with lot of money can take away the market share  
  what is the unlisted players market share - 
  listed peers market share - Netflix ()
  postion among peers - 1
  global competettion - imports risk from china or any other low cost producer country?
  threat of new entrants

3)Listed peers Comparison: tijori(benchmark) and screener peer comparison sections for profitability and costs

4)Products/services Uniqueness and Quality check :
what makes the product or service of this company Unique?
  //does it delight the customers - when they don't find that product in a store will they go across the street to get it
  //does it own consumers mind(i.e people always remember this company when u talk about a specific product like drink,burger,choc etc)
  //what value does it add to customers compared to competetiors?
  while other competetiors find international markets as export destination for US content but Netflix believes blockbuster can be
  made anywhere and focuses on localisation. Netflix is now producing films and TV in more than 50 countries with a high degree 
  of integration in the local entertainment 
   ecosystem resulting in the creation of blockbusters from every region
  //how is the quality of product/service - Have u used the product/service ? 
    if YES, what is your view - smooth UI 
    if NO, go and open their website, check public review in ecommerce or google search


------------------- FUTURE -----------------
---Goal/Aim that the company wants to achieve and what is the Strategy that it wants to employ?
//Goal/Aim - global leader, capture market share from unorganised players, cleanup stuff and become efficient etc
//Strategies being employed: 
ideally a company that clones other successful strategies is almost bound to win provided it has other necessary qualifications


--- EARNING POWER (Earnings Growth Oppurtunities check )
//SOURCE OF EARNINGS
--Internal Growth oppurtunities 
monetising sharing viewers per subscriber (only 55% pay for subscription, remaing share the credentials of friends/family)
introducing subscription with ads - giving the service at lesser price for users who need it
focus on games and animated series - creating more value for money paid by subscribers
sports documentaries
orginal content acquisition - by collaboration of the ground team with producers
broadband and smart TV penetration will improve OTT subscriptions
Asia and Latin America Volumes and ARPU is very low compared to US, Europe taking in consideration the population - 
  increase will drive revenues (if management focuses on international expansion)

--External Growth oppurtunities
Macroeconomic :
 focus on Indian content and subscribers by reducing prices and giving quality content
Tailwinds

---- Sustainability of Earning power: MOATS and Pricing Power to make it a long term bet
1)Competettive advantage/MOAT Check?
Economises of Scale - demand side
Brand
Network effect - more production houses in the world collarborate with Netflix


2)PRICING POWER (MUST HAVE MOAT)
IF NO?  what can be done to counter the absence of pricing power?
  --Hence backward integration or having long term contracts will be a plus to maintain predictability
  --Significant volume increase - and become a low cost producer (market share)
  --maintain low debt - incase international prices drops significantly they don't have a choice but to decrease the price for not 
  losing business , even though their costs have increased and should be in a position to take debt if required
  --achieve operating efficiency so that operating cost is less

3) Longterm vs short term bet
/Preferred Investment: Both MOATS and Earnings Growth oppurtunities need to exist for sustainable Earnings
/Company with No Moats  but very high growth oppurtunities - a short term buy becuase other competetiors with MOATS can take away the
market share soon - need to monitor closely
/Company with good MOATS but not very good growth oppurtunities - it has become a slow grower(if they genrate a stable free cashflow
you can use the cash to buy other growth and non-growth businesses) 
Note: Don't forget to compare dividend yield with FD interest rates


----Capital Allocation 
//SOURCE OF CAPITAL - Debt/Retained Earnings/New Equity


//USE OF NEW/INCREMENTAL CAPITAL : A good company always uses capital for progressing and next phase growth and not for survival 
Cash
Organic growth - putting back the money in the same business
Inorganic growth - M&A
Dividends
Buyback - preferred
Capex - new
Capex - old PLANT/MACHINERY maintainance (this can't be for ever year meaning sustainence capex is bad for the company)
modernising or technology upgradation of operations
R&D
Advertising
Working capital (tied up in) - bad


//RETURN ON CAPITAL
Good company: ROCE/ROIC(return on capital) > WACC (cost of cpital)
Very Good company: ROCE/ROIC(return on capital) >>> WACC (cost of cpital)
Ideal company : if it can redeploy the incremental capital for same/high returns over time - it becomes a compounding machine

// SUMMARY (Business Quality Check) - decided by PAST, PRESENT and FUTURE of the company
  -Predictable and consistent/recurring EARNINGS for next 10 yrs(MOATS, pricing power)
  -Competes on value rather than price bcoz company that competes on value is like a magnet with stronger magnetic field  that
    attracts customers and companies which compete on price will lose their business to competetiors
  -prefer high margin non commoditized business - if commoditized then must be a low cost producer
  -lousy industry/highly competettive industry/niche industry(no big players have entered yet) ?
  -proxy play on some capital intensive/debt heavy/lousy industry ? 
  -Superior economics (what does company produce, target audience and how does it produce): ESG Principles
   Environmental: does the process/products cause any kind of pollution
   Social: does the products/services add some value to customers or do they waste their time or money or destroy their health
   Governance: Superior Management and board of directors
  -Scalable business model - globally preferred (mutibagger are made because of this property)
  -Company having calibre or potential to adapt to the changing business environment - having said that invest 
    in a business with slow rate of change, rapid change is the enemy of an investor as it needs more capital to adapt and 
    burns more cash to be in the competettion)
  -Having Tailwinds is an added advantage as it boosts the process of wealth creation and helps u in achieving goal faster

----------------------------------- RISKS ----------------------------------------
check Risk_Check.txt
---Business Risk:
capital intensive buinsess , i.e netflix needs capital every year to invest in original and licensed content - means it relies on
  economies of scale, and hence user base and ARPU are very important params to track
piracy is a threat to the Industry itself
222m paying households, Netflix is being shared with over 100m additional households - unless this is monetised it’s harder to grow
  membership in many markets
competettion - very low entry barriers and all the major production houses who were initially selling their movies to Netflix , now
  came up with their own streaming service
ARPU in US and Europe regions increased and Asia , Latin America regions remained constant for last 5 yrs

---Financial Risk:
D/E is 1.6 times which is high
free cash flow will take a hit for few yrs as Netflix spends money on producing original content (assets)
Netflix current cashflow of 500M not enough to service longterm debt in 10yrs, it needs to 4X its cashflow

---Management Risk:

---Investment Returns Risk:

--------------------- PRESENT --------------------
---Sectoral analysis: 
//STAGE of development: growth - internet
//Sector value chain : collect money from customers => deduct charges (Revenue) => credit merchants
//Market size/Oppurtunity or possible demand for the Sector: it is not about how big a company is, it is about how big a company can get
   domestic and global :
        not limited to a single user (almost every user will find its usage now or eventually)
        not limited to single business (almost every business will find its usage now or eventually)

---Products/services DEMAND check :
//From where does the actual demand from for the company? 
  B2C - mostly US
  Business service companies
  Global - somewhat

//Type of demand
    continous and growing demand - payment related
    Transition Demand - traditional payments to digital wallet(competettion tracking is important)


---Products/services SUPPLY check :
1)Product portfolio :
payouts - PayPal mass pay option, Payouts, is one such solution. The account holder can easily send money to multiple people at the 
  same time, and the recipients will receive the funds in their PayPal account.
Digital wallet: You can save and access details of your debit and credit cards through your PayPal account, being able to
 shop and transfer money simply via PayPal ID and password; buy now pay later, crypto payments , QR code payments included in the app

Money transfer: You are able to transfer money to more than 200 countries and over 100 currencies, both to and from a bank account or a PayPal account;
Payment gateway: checkout Jourmey in e-commerce (They recently acquired Happy Returns (for inperson return) and integrating it with e-commerce and retail stores)

Paypal Credit: buy now pay later (credit card replacement)
Capital loan: A daily payable loan with a lower fee than banks.

2)COMPETETION : 
  Total payment volumes market share :

  global competettion -  Visa Inc. (V), Mastercard Inc. (MA), Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOGL) Google Pay, JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s (JPM) WePay,
    Square Inc. (SQ), and from Local markets
  threat of new entrants - Amazon pay , Gpay , e-bay came up with own wallet etc

3)Listed peers Comparison: tijori(benchmark) and screener peer comparison sections for profitability and costs
Digital wallet peers Paypal wins
But comparing with Visa And Mastercard - they clearly win interms of Net margin and ROE

     support for Multiple payment methods.
    Security - paypal provides additional security layer where credentials , card details and accounts doesn't travel over 
     the network and stay within paypal servers. Also email id,mobile,username or personal QR is needed to recieve money, no 
     need to expose ur bank account or card details to everyone
    Checkout - If you don't receive a product you buy with PayPal, you'll get your money back.


------------------- FUTURE -----------------
---Goal/Aim that the company wants to achieve and what is the Strategy that it wants to employ?
//Goal/Aim - global leader in digital wallet, capture market share in checkout process
//Strategies being employed: not clearly defined

--- EARNING POWER (Earnings Growth Oppurtunities check )
//SOURCE OF EARNINGS
--Internal Growth oppurtunities
penetration - Acquire new customers in untapped areas 
old customers transacting more
Launch New products BNPL and crypto additions
QR codes share is very less in offline stores (people still prefer using debit and credit cards)
Less than half the time that a PayPal customer has the opportunity to use us, they actually take advantage of that. We can
  double the size of our business with our current user base if people just use us when they can.
Venmo, Braintree revenues can be significant goin forward that they can contribute to the mix
Venmo integration with Amazon is yet to be seen

--External Growth oppurtunities
Acquistions
Macroeconomic - only 50% penetration in the US (core market)
Tailwinds -COVID and non-touch payments pick up

---- Sustainability of Earning power: MOATS and Pricing Power to make it a long term bet
1)Competettive advantage/MOAT Check?
Brand - Trust
Network effect - global two-sided network of consumers and merchants 
Intangible assets - security and ease of access and transfer

2)PRICING POWER (MUST HAVE MOAT) - unfortunately it doesn't have one bcoz of the substitutes available


----Capital Allocation 
//SOURCE OF CAPITAL - Debt + Retained Earnings


//USE OF NEW/INCREMENTAL CAPITAL : A good company always uses capital for progressing and next phase growth and not for survival 
Inorganic growth - M&A
Buyback 
Advertising - little


//RETURN ON CAPITAL
WACC : 12.33%, ROCE : 12.86%
Avg company interms of Capital returns: just breakseven

// SUMMARY (Business Quality Check) - decided by PAST, PRESENT and FUTURE of the company
  MOSTLY -Predictable and consistent/recurring EARNINGS for next 10 yrs(MOATS, pricing power)
  YES -Competes on value rather than price bcoz company that competes on value is like a magnet with stronger magnetic field  that
    attracts customers and companies which compete on price will lose their business to competetiors
  Non commoditized business - people don't trust unknown plyaers with their finances handling
  Non - cyclical
  Highly competettive industry (it needs more capital to adapt to the changing business environment and burns more cash to
    be in the competettion)
  Almost recession proof
  ESG clean
  Scalable business model - globally preferred (mutibagger are made because of this property)
  Having Tailwinds
  YES-If a person has lot of money can he break ur business and take away marketshare?
  Avg company interms of Capital returns: just breakseven i.e WACC =~ ROCE


------------------------------ FINANCIAL STRENGTH CHECK --------------------------
check Financial_Strength_Check.txt
--expenses breakup and see which expenses are growing YOY
Transaction costs (MDR payed to credit card companies and banks)
paypal to paypal transfer cost is ZERO for same currency
Interest expense - 2%

//Financial strengths
Gross proft margin is good

//Financial weakness
R&D cost - 28% of operating profit
thin margins
low profitability compared to peers

------------------------------ MANAGEMENT CHECK --------------------------------
//how is the Management and their Vision: check management discussion analysis in annual report
--view is let’s concentrate on our engagement in basically our core markets where we have a multiplicity of services, where we 
have our digital wallet, and not spend a ton of money on higher beta opportunities internationally where we need to roll out, 
support new services, and build awareness.
--we want to unify all of the things that we’ve bought as well into one common platform.  
2 core focus areas 
1)Investment in e-commerce checkout Jounrney
2)Digital wallet

----------------------------------- RISKS ----------------------------------------
check Risk_Check.txt
---Business Risk:
Consumers going back to more in-store experiences, as well as more services versus goods, both of which are sort of contrary 
  to what our platform provides, or is not where our strengths are.
Competettion Risk: especially in local markets, in international markets if competettion can remove that extra cost while 
   transferring money via QR or internationally
substitution risk - customers can quickly shift to other company services
loans to merchants and Paypal credit(buy now pay later) can be probable NPAs (but since paypal has the data it can take wise decision)


---Financial Risk:
Probable Weak balance sheet (if subsidaries don't perform) - Entire Equity in balance sheet is mapped to Acquistions 

---Management Risk: NA

---Investment Returns Risk: might have to suffer oppurtunity cost if you invest at higher valuations

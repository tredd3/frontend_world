any research report/youtube analysis available for the company: 
what peter lynch bucket does stock belongs to : stalwarts 

--------------------- PRESENT --------------------
---Sectoral analysis: 
sector : semiconductor, industry : foundry
semiconductor industry’s economics - strive for higher productivity and lower cost
i.e the energy, cost and time required for electronic computations can be reduced by shrinking transistors on microchips
foundry business revenues 102 billion $ (TSMC clocked 57 billion $)
TSMC expects foundry segment revenue to outpace the high single-digit CAGR projected for the worldwide semiconductor market 
 excluding memory from 2021 through 2026.

//STAGE of development: growth

//Sector value chain : suppliers(ARM, MIPS) - Software(Cadence, Synopsys) - EUV machine by ASML - foundry - fabless companies - consumers

//Market size/Oppurtunity or possible demand for the Sector: it is not about how big a company is, it is about how big a company can get
   global oppurtunity/exports :
        not limited to a single user (almost every user will find its usage now or eventually)
        not limited to single business (almost every business will find its usage now or eventually)

---Products/services DEMAND check :
//From where does the actual demand come for the company? 
  Global businesses - smartphones(5G), high performance computing (HPC), Internet of Things (IoT), automotive and electronics

//Type of demand
    continous and replacement/upgradation demand based on latest trends/depreciation - value addition (clothing and footwear, 
        Electronics, Automobile,home furnishing)
     Transition Demand - EV, Renewable Energy, 5G, New Technology - need a lot of research as it can make or break your portfolio
      bcoz of high competettion given the size of oppurtunity

high performance computing (HPC) - advanced process technologies specific to HPC, advanced 3D packaging designs
Internet of Things (IoT) - ultra low power process technologies
automotive - wide variety of process technologies
Digital Consumer Electronics  - advanced technologies and large-scale capacity


2)COMPETETION :  lousy industry that needs heavy capital investment and lot of skilled workforce - hence only 2 survived ,
TSMC and Samsung (since samsung is also in to design and product development, this work as a captive consumption)
Also samsung makes chips in the world (but it focuses on memory chips, unlike TSMC which focuses on advanced logic chips)

4)Products/services Uniqueness and Quality check :
what makes the product or service of this company Unique?
  //does it delight the customers - technology advancement and resilient capacity 
  //does it own consumers mind(i.e people always remember this company when u talk about a specific product like drink,burger,choc etc)
    it owns minds of fabless companies, the only company in the world that produces 5nm chips (apart from samsung)
  //what value does it add to customers compared to competetiors?
    technology leadership, manufacturing excellence and customer trust(never compete with its customers, never designed, 
    manufactured or marketed any integrated circuits under its own name)
  //how is the quality of product/service - Good


------------------- FUTURE -----------------
---Goal/Aim that the company wants to achieve and what is the Strategy that it wants to employ?
//Goal/Aim - global leader, capture market share from unorganised players, cleanup stuff and become efficient etc
//Strategies being employed: 
ideally a company that clones other successful strategies is almost bound to win provided it has other necessary qualifications


--- EARNING POWER 
Earning Power is the ability of the company to grow or compound its earnings every year for a very longtime 

1)SOURCE OF EARNINGS (Earnings Growth Oppurtunities check )
earnings source is more than earnings itself bcoz earnings source decides whether the earning growth is sustainable or not, 
  i.e it decides quality of earnings

i)INTERNAL GROWTH OPPURTUNITIES
///Sales Growth led Earnings Growth(every firm needs this kind of growth)     
  1)Demand/Consumption led growth from NEW customers (Volume led growth)
    /We expect HPC to be the main engine of TSMC's long-term growth and the largest contributor in terms of our incremental revenue
    growth in the next several years - multi-year megatrends of 5G and High Performance Computing (HPC)-related applications are expected to fuel massive demand for computation power,
    strategic relationships with our customers are long term in nature
    /Good spend on R&D to stay ahead of the curve - Our 2-nanometer technology will be the most advanced semiconductor technology
    in the industry in both density and energy-efficiency when it is introduced, and will further extend our leadership position in future.
    /Strong Order inflows - demand > existing capacity
    /TSMC capturing market share from current 26%
    /expand TSMC’s business and service infrastructure into emerging and developing markets.
  2)Demand/Consumption led growth from OLD customers (Volume led growth)
    /increased consumption(volume led growth) - cutomers of TSMC gain market share
    /Launch New products with latest tech like 5G, IOT etc needs more advanced chips

///Efficiency led Earnings Growth(few firms have achieved it, they just need to maintain)
    /spending on technology for achieving efficiency and modernising the workflow or processes
    /process technology 

ii)EXTERNAL: GROWTH OPPURTUNITIES
/Macroeconomic oppurtunity
  It is in a growing sector with tailwinds - every company in the sector will grow like Indian IT companies, chemicals etc
   even if the company retains its market share and can sustain over the years it can grow effortlessly
  Tailwinds - 5G, HPC usage

2)Sustainability of Earnings: MOATS and Pricing Power to make it a long term bet
i)Competettive advantage/MOAT Check? check MOATS_check.txt
MOAT - is the trait or quality that a business has bcoz of which competettion cannot snatch away its earnings and customers
Note: do not invest in businesses whose moats are primarily driven by regulations and political linkages.
Economises of Scale
Brand - must be accompained with pricing power
Intangible assets
Switching costs
Entry barriers - manufacturing chips has become extremely complicated and costly 


ii)PRICING POWER (MUST HAVE MOAT)- 
pricing - based on value creation, strategic and not oppurtunistic, but during unforseen situations TSMC always increases the 
 prices and pass on the additional cost to customers

Note: Pricing power is must for capex heavy companies(high fixed cost or operating leverage) companies with large amounts of
 debt - otherwise they can go Bankruptcy and destroy shareholder's wealth during recession.

Thesis :
/Longterm Investment: Both MOATS and Earnings Growth oppurtunities exists
/Shorterm Investment: Company with No Moats  but very high growth oppurtunities - a short term buy becuase other competetiors 
 with MOATS can take away the market share soon - need to monitor closely
/Company with good MOATS but not very good growth oppurtunities - it has become a slow grower(if they genrate a stable free cashflow
you can use the cash to buy other growth and non-growth businesses) 
Note: Don't forget to compare dividend yield with FD interest rates


----Capital Allocation 
//SOURCE OF CAPITAL - less Debt + more Retained Earnings


---USE OF NEW/INCREMENTAL CAPITAL : A good company always uses capital for achieving operating efficiency or focus on next phase
 growth and not for survival (like expenses , capex maintenance etc) - if it uses for survival then it is capital intensive business
Dividends - most mature companies give out dividends as they don't find better oppurtunities to re-invest profits
Capex - new
Capex - old PLANT/MACHINERY maintainance (this can't be for ever year meaning sustainence capex is bad for the company)
modernising or technology upgradation of operations
R&D - for future business but the amount spent has to be monitored


//RETURN ON CAPITAL
Good company: Capital is increasing and ROCE is constant at 23%


// SUMMARY (Business Quality Check) - decided by PAST, PRESENT and FUTURE of the company
  -Superior economics (what does company produce, target audience and how does it produce):
    customers' demand continue to exceed our ability to supply. 
    TSMC's technology position is much stronger today as compared to previous years (process optimisation)
    MSCI ESG Research’s AAA Rating - Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations
  -Predictable and consistent EARNINGS for next 10 yrs(sticky and recurring)
  -Competes on value rather than price bcoz - by spending on R&D and capex upgradation
  - non commoditized business and  non-cyclical (structural change in demand)
  - recession proof because of the wide use of chips in almost every device
  -lousy industry - one of the 2 survivors in the world
  -proxy play on high tech and digital transformation of the world
  -Company having calibre or potential to adapt to the changing business environment - R&D spending is good
  -Scalable business model - globally preferred (mutibagger are made because of this property)
  -Having Tailwinds is an added advantage as it boosts the process of wealth creation and helps u in achieving goal faster
  -If a person has lot of money can he break ur business and take away marketshare? Very difficult
  -Not an ideal business bcoz it needs a lot of capital to operate but it earns same high returns on incremental capital

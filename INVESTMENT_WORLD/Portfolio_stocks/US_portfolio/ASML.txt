  Valuation is what differentiates Great Investment from a great business
  will it beat Index in the next 10yrs if you buy at current valuations(https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nKjmPeIAiBJj7I_hbipXbBysa4ZhoK9qVxh6spmKejo/edit#gid=0)

------------------- SCREENING SUMMARY -------------------
//General check:
  stock picking strategy: bottoms-up/top-down/cloning/contratian/familiar with the product or industry/profits going down due to 
     capacity to suffer/suggestion from youtuber or broker
  Normal check on stock price since inception - google search (any abnormal increase or decrease in share price?)
  Abnormal falling: google search why a company share is falling - check Why_Stock_Price_Falling.txt
  Abnormal increase: EPS, PE, manipulation(FII/DII buying at random prices taking share 
    prices up and lock  retail folks at higher prices OR buying via shell companies inflating 
    the share price naturally like Adani once did)
  legal orders(confirm from wiki) and tickertape
  corporate actions, dividend history and announcements from tickertape
  check shareholding pattern(especially promoter) trend over the years in tijori
    Promoter holding : higher is the better
    Institutional ownership: lower is the better because if the company performs well they keep buying it and share price takes off
  promoter pledging
  Is the business easy to understand or complex : easy/complex
  circle of competence: Yes/No
  any recent insider buying (bse india > disclosures > insider trading) OR Value Research(ownership section) for US stocks
  (Especially if normal employees are buying apart form promoters/top management then its a positive sign as they know better
     than any broker/analyst/investor)
  any bulk or block deals (to discover price?

//Business check:
  screener pros and cons
  market share trend
  //how is the quality of product/service - Have u used the product/service ? 
    if YES, what is your view 
    if NO, go and open their website, check public review in ecommerce or google search
  CRISIL Rating must be Above A and check Rating History for last 3 Years - upgraded from BBB to A-
  can a fool run this business
  can you put 50% of your net worth, buy the whole business and forget about it for next 5-10 yrs ???
   assuming that stock market is closed for next 5-10yrs are you ok holding the entire business without knowing its price every year?
  for longterm : don't invest in a stock just bcoz the stock price will increase, invest because you want to own that business

//Finance check:
1)Balance sheet Strength check: asset light
--Equity/Total assets (liabilities should be as less as possible for a strong balance sheet) 33%
--(Price to book value) - 5 (not an asset play)

//non-current assets - 14k
Net block 6k
Goodwill 5k

//Net current assets - 7k inventory

//shareholder Equity - 11k
--Check Equity CAGR from balance sheet equity section 
   constant because of share buybacks and dividends

//non-current Liabilities - 9k


2)Profit and loss statement: clean
10% of revenue on R&D
  
3)Cashflow statement
--use of cash flow from operations: share buybacks and dividends

4)Profitability Ratios Check:
GPM 50%, OPM 36% , NPM 31%, ROCE 35%, ROE 56%

//Valuation check
--EV/FCF(Market cap + debt - cash&cash equivalents)/Free cash flow Valuation: 36
--PEG: 2.8
--DCF: max gains 12% CAGR (for next 10 yrs) - driven by earnings

     circular economy:
      Reduce waste in our operations
      Re-use parts and materials from the installed base
      Recycle mature products through refurbishment - refurbish used DUV, EUV machines 
  Subsidaries/JVs:

  Clients(only 5 bcoz of the machines cost): Micron, SK hynix, Micron, Samsung, TSMC and Intel
promoters:
why did the promoters start the business: to capture the huge oppurtunity in some industry/sector OR passion
any research report/youtube analysis available for the company: 
what peter lynch bucket does stock belongs to : stalwarts

--------------------- PRESENT --------------------
---Sectoral analysis: 
Global megatrends are driving growth in the semiconductor industry: distributed computing and storage
The electronics industry is booming – there are around 40 billion connected devices in use today, and that
number is expected to grow to 350 billion in the next ten years based on external source data.
The chip market (worldwide semiconductor revenues) has grown by 5% per year in revenue on average over the past 20 years
2020 market size: 466 billion$, 2030 market size: 1000 billion$ (10% CAGR)

//STAGE of development: slow growth (transistioning to stalwart in the this decade)

//Sector value chain : suppliers(ARM, MIPS) - Software(Cadence, Synopsys) - EUV machine by ASML - foundry - fabless companies - consumers

//Market size/Oppurtunity or possible demand for the Sector: it is not about how big a company is, it is about how big a company can get
   global oppurtunity/exports :
        limited to few businesses/limited customer usage

---Products/services DEMAND check :
//From where does the actual demand from for the company? 
   2 types of customers: 
    Memory chips: NAND and DRAM
    Logic chips:  integrated device manufacturers (IDMs), foundries (produce chips for ‘fabless’ companies, which focus only on 
      chip design and distribution, but do not manufacture microchips themselves)
    Demand comes Only from 5 semiconductor companies (Micron, SK hynix, Micron, Samsung, TSMC and Intel)

//Type of demand
    not a one time demand unlike other capex catering companies - every 2 yrs machines either need to be upgraded or replaced
     94% machines upgraded at client location and 6% replaced
    continous and replacement/upgradation demand based on latest trends/depreciation - value addition (clothing and footwear, 
        Electronics, Automobile,home furnishing)

---Products/services SUPPLY check :
1)Product portfolio - what all products company manufactures (you can find in investor presentation) - check revenue contribution 
  of each product
DUV machine - less advanced chips (usage - waching machine, fridge, TV)
EUV machine - highly advanced chips (pcs, servers, data centres, automobile, planes, IOT)


2)COMPETETION :  None bcoz of the R&D costs and no gaurantee of success in the field
differentiation provided to Customers:
ASML solutions and systems help increases the value and lowers the cost of a chip,
helps our customers to produce microchips – using fewer materials and consuming less energy during production

------------------- FUTURE -----------------
---Goal/Aim that the company wants to achieve and what is the Strategy that it wants to employ?
//Goal/Aim - global leader, capture market share from unorganised players, cleanup stuff and become efficient etc
//Strategies being employed: 
heavy engagement with R&D and maintain leadership

--- EARNING POWER 
Earning Power is the ability of the company to grow or compound its earnings every year for a very longtime 

1)SOURCE OF EARNINGS (Earnings Growth Oppurtunities check )
earnings source is more than earnings itself bcoz earnings source decides whether the earning growth is sustainable or not, 
  i.e it decides quality of earnings

i)INTERNAL GROWTH OPPURTUNITIES
///Sales Growth led Earnings Growth(every firm needs this kind of growth)     
  1)Demand/Consumption led growth from NEW customers (Volume led growth)
    /Capex addition - more and more countries announcing fab establishments roughly 72 new fabs around the world 
      55 in Asia , 10 Americas, 7 Europe (lot of demand for DUV , EUV machines)
    /The most important end markets driving ASML’s growth are the smartphone market and the data center, server
     and storage market, but at the same time we are also seeing a huge increase in microchip demand in the
     automotive and industrial electronics markets. 
  2)Demand/Consumption led growth from OLD customers (Volume led growth)
    /increased consumption(volume led growth) - old cutomers building more and more fabs for advanced chip manufacturing
    /Launch New products - FY21 : EUVs, high NA machines, upgrade existing machines

///Efficiency led Earnings Growth(few firms have achieved it, they just need to maintain)
    /increasing the productivity of all our machine types - vision to improve energy efficiency of chips three-fold every 
      two years, over the next 20 years (meaning every 2 yrs client needs to spend on capex)
    /cost reduction by using circular economy (reduce, re-cycle and re-use)

ii)EXTERNAL: GROWTH OPPURTUNITIES
  /Acquistion and synergy led growth(Acquistion for strategic purpose(augumenting existing business like acquiring firm that supplies
    key raw materials, firm that has excellent technology and skilled manpower, firm that has reputation globally and is present in 
    areas where the current firm doesn't OR in simple words acquire any firm that adds value by doing something which the current 
    firm doesn't OR any firm that increases the efficieny of the current firm operations) 
  /vertical integration - zero dependence on others, high avialbility, cost advantage and quality control e.g: Apple, Amazon
  /backward or forward integration
  /Macroeconomic oppurtunity - sector will grow at 10% CAGR for in this decade
  /Tailwinds - chips act signifies the strategic importance of chip manufacturing in the country, giving incentives to foundry players

2)Sustainability of Earnings: MOATS and Pricing Power to make it a long term bet
i)Competettive advantage/MOAT Check? check MOATS_check.txt
MOAT - is the trait or quality that a business has bcoz of which competettion cannot snatch away its earnings and customers
Brand - must be accompained with pricing power
Network effect of 800 suppliers
Intangible assets - keep Innovating and filing patents
Switching costs - ONLY option to foundry players to build chips on scale
Entry barriers - competetiors might take  decades to build EUV system and that too with no guarantee of success
Luxury/Premium Range - each machine costs 200 billion$
Monopoly


ii)PRICING POWER (MUST HAVE MOAT)- very high
  The product or service is unique and there is NO substitute

----Capital Allocation 
//SOURCE OF CAPITAL - Retained Earnings

---USE OF NEW/INCREMENTAL CAPITAL : A good company always uses capital for achieving operating efficiency or focus on next phase
 growth and not for survival (like expenses , capex maintenance etc) - if it uses for survival then it is capital intensive business
Inorganic growth - M&A for strategic purpose or to build a MOAT
Dividends - most mature companies give out dividends as they don't find better oppurtunities to re-invest profits
Buyback - 50% revenues
Capex - new(very little)
R&D - 15% revenues


//RETURN ON CAPITAL
https://goodcalculators.com/wacc-calculator/
why Return on Capital is important?
Over the longterm the investment returns will always resemble the capital returns

Good company: ROCE is increasing and capital is constant 

// SUMMARY (Business Quality Check) - decided by PAST, PRESENT and FUTURE of the company
  -Superior economics (what does company produce, target audience and how does it produce): ESG Principles
   Environmental: does the process/products cause any kind of pollution
   Social: does the products/services add some value to customers or do they waste their time or money or destroy their health
   Governance: Superior Management and board of directors
  -Predictable and consistent EARNINGS for next 10 yrs(sticky and recurring)
  -Competes on value rather than price bcoz company that competes on value is like a magnet with stronger magnetic field  that
    attracts customers and companies which compete on price will lose their business to competetiors
  -non commoditized business , recently became non-cyclical and  recession proof
  -niche industry
  -proxy play on semiconductor industry capex 
  -Company having calibre or potential to adapt to the changing business environment - having said that invest 
    in a business with slow rate of change, rapid change is the enemy of an investor as it needs more capital to adapt and 
    burns more cash to be in the competettion)
  -Scalable business model globally - but very limited customers
  -Having Tailwinds
  -If a person has lot of money can he break ur business and take away marketshare? NO
  -Not an Ideal business as it takes 20% of revenues as R&D cost


------------------------------ FINANCIAL STRENGTH CHECK --------------------------
check Financial_Strength_Check.txt
--expenses breakup and see which expenses are growing YOY
//Financial strengths
//Financial weakness

------------------------------ MANAGEMENT CHECK --------------------------------
//how is the Management and their Vision: check management discussion analysis in annual report
Note: Ideally we should invest in a business which even a fool can run because someday or the other a fool does - Warren Buffet
and then if u put a capable and passionate management he will do wonders for you
check Management_Check.txt

----------------------------------- RISKS ----------------------------------------
check Risk_Check.txt
---Business Risk:
not allowed to export machines to china
The success of new product introductions is uncertain and depends on our ability to successfully execute our R&D programs
most of our revenues from the sale of a relatively small number of products and limited clients


---Financial Risk:
foreign exchange risk

---Management Risk:

---Investment Returns Risk:

//All about investing in US Stocks:
https://vested.co.in/blog/how-to-invest-in-the-us-stock-market-from-india/
** Investing in US stocks or ETFs by Indian investors is permissible under the RBI’s Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS)
1)Tax:
--Taxes on investment gains: You will be taxed in India for this gain
STCG: Less than 24 months, Income tax slab rate (+ surcharge and cess)
LTCG: More than 24 months @ 20% + indexation benefit (same as debt funds in india)
for ETFs the period is 36 months and for stocks as mentioned it is 24 months
--Taxes on dividends: Unlike investment gains, dividends will be taxed in the US at a flat rate of 25%.
For e.g: if Microsoft gives an investor $100 of dividend, it will withhold $25 as tax, and will give the investor 
the post tax dividend of $75. Subsequently, this post tax dividend is included as taxable income in India (as normal income).
Fortunately, US and India have a Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA), which allows taxpayers to offset income tax already
 paid in the US. The 25% tax you already paid in the US is made available as Foreign Tax Credit and can be used to offset your 
 income tax payable in India.
2)you are allowed to invest up to US $250,000 per year per person (roughly 2cr)
Once the remittance amount exceeds 5 lakh rupees per person per year u need to submit form 15CA
3)Convert INR to USD - GST of 0.18% is charged 
i.e 180rs for every 1lakh deposited
4)USD to INR - $11 withdrawal in vested
in Ind Money if the withdrawl amount exceeds $2000 it is free
Note: Both Vested and Ind money are investment advisory firms, hence they never keep ur cash/Stocks with them
Its either the broker that keeps both the USD cash and the securities.
5)What if he runs with the money/goes bankrupt? - Insurance covers for us
we are Insured up to $250k(cash) and up to $250k(securities), i.e total $500k under SIPC Act
6)Buy fractional shares unlike india 
Note: But keep more money in India as india's growth will be much higher, however Global monopolies and growth companies 
 can give you significant returns over longterm

//SEC important filings to read before investing in the market
10-k : longer version of annual report
readers of a 10-K should also pay attention to its "Item 1", which explains what the company does, who its customers are, and the 
 primary industry in which it operates.
pay attention to footnotes.

13-F : holdings report

20-F : annual report of foreign companies listed in the US

10-Q: quarterly updates(Investors can use the 10-Q to observe any changes that may be taking place within the corporation even before it files its annual report.)

8-K is what a company uses to disclose major developments that occur between filings of the Form 10-K or Form 10-Q. Major company 
 events that would necessitate the filing of a Form 8-K include bankruptcies, completion of acquisition or disposition of assets,
 or departures or appointments of executives

proxy statement: investors can view the salaries of the management of a company and any other perks that a company's management is eligible for.

form 3, 4, 5 - indisder trading of large shareholders (insiders might sell their shares for any number of reasons, but they buy
  them for only one: they think the price will rise over the long term and they might know stuff that u don't)

Schedule 13 D: when any owner acquires 5% or more of the voting shares in a company. Schedule 13D was designed to give individual 
   investors warning of impending changes to corporate control that could impact the future of the company,Investors use 
   Schedule 13D to both detect red flags in the consolidation of insider ownership that can be potentially harmful to individual
  shareholders, but also as a possible harbinger of a company being acquired or bought out, which could benefit shareholders.

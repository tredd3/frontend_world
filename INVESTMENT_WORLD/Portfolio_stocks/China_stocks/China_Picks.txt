China's Economy focus: 
 slower and more sustainable growth - good for a longterm investor
 more equal wealth distribution -> more money in individual's bank account -> consumption led growth and investing in stock markets
 non-debt driven growth - placed limits on debt taken by each company
 carbon emission free environment - major shift towards renewables by getting rid of companies in lower end of supply chain that are
 polluting(like textile, steel, chemicals etc) => can lead to inflation bcoz of demand and supply mismatch
 tech crack down - more focus on private data safety
 Chinese govt has brought up so many people from poverty in a very less time


Why Investing in china(expecially tech) is not a threat?
 China's 40% GDP is coming from digital economy
 90% urban employmnt is from private sector 
 china needs to be self-reliant(especially no dependence on the US) which means it has to encourage innovation
 china cannpt ban listing of its companies in the foreign exchanges especially the VIE structure (if it does it will lose foreign 
  investor confidence meaning slowdown of chinese economy)
 SO CHINESE GOVT WILL DO A MORE SCRUTINY OF TECH COMPANIES BUT WON'T BAN/NATIONALISE THEM

Non chinese individual investors can only buy and sell mainland-listed stocks through the Hong Kong exchange.
However, mutual fund and big institutions have a greater access to mainland listed stocks.
Hence ADRs came in where institutions hold the direct stocks of chinese companies and issue ADRs backed by chinese/foreign company stocks
Also VIE(variable interest entity) - where a shell company is created and holds the stocks(individual people can be investors and  
  will get returns but they don't have ownership)
Delisting risk from US: if a chinese company is listed in the US and it doesn't follow American auditing standards for 3 yrs in a row
  then Acc to US law stocks will get delisted from US Exchanges.But china doesn't allow any one to audit the chinese companies and
  foreign companies listed in china. Hence the concern
Delisting risk from China: if a company doesn't follow chinese govt laws/regulations , doesn't follow data breach policies and bypass 
  everything and then get listed on US exchanges then chinese govt will stop the business of the company and eventually ask them to delist
  But In the first place you should not invest in the companies who does all such fraud and doesn't obey chinese govt
  China doesn't want to compromise on the data and National security, it want all the firms to adhere to chinese laws/regulations
  It has no intention of delisting all the VIEs in the US or not allowing the new VIEs

Safe Bet: Hongkong Exchange seems to be a safer bet as china doesn't have any issues from their companies being listed on that exchange infact
they don't have problem with their companies being listed even in the US as they get foreign capital and economy grows, tax revenue increase,
people standard of life increases and so on... but US govt want to audit the companies listed in their exchanges hence the problem

Indexes: 
CSI 300(broader chinese index) - top 300 stocks traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. 
  heaviest bets in consumer defensive and financial services
  CSI 300 is considered blue chip index for Mainland China stock exchanges (treated as S&P 500 of the US)
  CSI full form -  China Securities Index


//ETFs and Funds(Both Index and Active)
Index Funds: focus on index funds but index composition is must - check index composition image
Active funds/ETFs: 
Some funds invest exclusively in China A shares (tilted toward more "old economy" sectors like financial services and energy)
some in HK-listed securities : currency fluctuation risk but but since hongkong dollar is pegged to USD there is not much issue 
  in currency fluctuation
while others primarily own American depositary shares(may get delisted if not ethical and follow right accounting, also china-US 
  tensions can lead to more regulations affecting the ADRs straight away)
Note: funds investing in companies listed on the Hong Kong exchange or as ADRs are more exposed to the communication services and 
 consumer cyclical sectors. so explore the possibility of combination

Research reports/analayst reports: i.e input a stock name and get the thorough report
Best sites: morningstar, zacks, seeking alpha, stock rover

//How to pick the best analyst/research websites:
1)Methodology: are u inline with that and agree to the params of valuation and analysis?
2)Quality of analysis: pick a stock and read the report in every site and how easy is for you to locate and get an idea on 
 the company
3)Availability: does all the company reports are available or not? - very important because top company stock reports are 
 avialbale with every one


 //Morning star:
 1)Moat
 Profitability : ROIC > WACC
 Wide Moat: sustainability of profitability for MORE that 20 years
 Narrow Moat: sustainability of profitability will fade away after 10 years
 No moat: will loss excess profits soon to competettion/profitability will fade away before 10 years because of some internal problem
 2) Moat trend
sources of economic moats: intangible assets, switching costs, network effect, cost advantage, and efficient scale.
firm’s moat trend is positive in cases where we think its sources of competitive
advantage are growing stronger; stable where we don’t anticipate changes to competitive advantages
over the next several years; 
Negative when we see signs of deterioration. The assumptions that we make about a firm’s economic moat play a vital role in
 determining the length of “economic outperformance” that we assume in the terminal sections of our valuation model
 3)intrinsic value based on free cash flow and longterm business prospects
 Analysts create custom industry and company assumptions to feed income statement, balance sheet, and capital investment assumptions 
 into our globally standardized, proprietary discounted cash flow, or DCF, modeling templates. 

 Reason to use DCF : Moreover, we think analyzing valuation through discounted cash flows presents a better lens for
viewing cyclical companies, high-growth firms, businesses with finite lives (such as mines), or
companies expected to generate negative earnings over the next few years. 
4)Margin of safety
Base case: operating and financial leverage, sales sensitivity to the overall economy,product concentration, pricing power, and 
  other company-specific factors.
Analysts consider at least two scenarios in addition to their base case: a bull case and a bear case.
Our uncertainty ratings are low, medium, high, very high, and extreme. With each uncertainty rating is a corresponding set of 
 price/fair value ratios that we use to assign star ratings
The more uncertain we are about the estimated value of the equity, the greater the discount we require relative to our estimate of 
 the value of the firm before we would recommend the purchase of the shares.

 Ratings: keeps changing based on the market price
 5 star: highly undervalued - extremely pessimestic outlook by the market -  best time to buy the stock based on fundamentals
 3 star: fairly valued
 2 star : slightly overvalued - We believe investors are likely to receive a less than fair risk-adjusted return and should consider
directing their capital elsewhere.
 1 star: over valued - extremely optimistic outlook by market - strong sell but again based on fundamentals
 Note: When there are many 5-star stocks, the stock market as a whole is more undervalued, in our opinion, than when very few 
   companies garner our highest rating.

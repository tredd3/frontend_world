--- EARNING POWER 
Earning Power is the ability of the company to grow or compound its earnings every year for a very longtime 

1)SOURCE OF EARNINGS (Earnings Growth Oppurtunities check )
earnings source is more than earnings itself bcoz earnings source decides whether the earning growth is sustainable or not, 
  i.e it decides quality of earnings

i)INTERNAL GROWTH OPPURTUNITIES
///Sales Growth led Earnings Growth(every firm needs this kind of growth)     
  1)Demand/Consumption led growth from NEW customers (Volume led growth)
    Services to AMC, AIFs, Insurance firms in the GIFT City - Global investors can now invest in India via GIFT city smoothly
    NPS CRA application and data on cloud (2 other players are Kfintech CRA, NSDL CRA) 
    CAMSfinserv enables rapid, secure and consent-based sharing of financial asset information with the consent of customers(Account aggregator)
    • For individuals - AA framework enables them to access and review their financial information in one place
    • For Financial institutions and businesses - AA Framework brings together Financial information providers and financial information users to unlock the
    value of customers financial information
    Note: CAMSfinserv does not view, store or have any access to use the customers’ data - so no cybersecurity/fraud issues
  2)Demand/Consumption led growth from OLD customers (Volume led growth)
    SIPs keep increasing
    Launch New products 

ii)EXTERNAL: GROWTH OPPURTUNITIES
  /Acquistion and synergy led growth - open to these
  /Macroeconomic oppurtunity
   india has the largest youth population in the world and AUM as % of GDP is 12% , globally it is 63%
   Equity AUM to GDP is 5% in india in the developed countries it is roughly 50%
   only 5% of assets in india are financial assets - even if in the next 10 yrs it goes to 15% then CAMS business increases 5 times 
  /Tailwinds - increase in disposable income, financial awareness, ease of investment at low cost, traditional investments(like FD)
    not able to beat inflation etc


Note: Internal growth is always preferred but sometimes the business size is so big that the size of internal growth oppurtunity 
   seems trivial and we need to opt for external growth. 
   for e.g: let us say if HUL identifies an internal growth oppurtunity that can increase its cash flow by 20% , however if HUL 
   opts and invests the capital in external growth oppurtunity instead, say acquisition then its cashflow grows by 50% then it
   is a no brainer to allocate capital for external growth opportunity by the Management


2)Sustainability of Earnings: MOATS and Pricing Power to make it a long term bet
i)Competettive advantage/MOAT Check? check MOATS_check.txt
MOAT - is the trait or quality that a business has bcoz of which competettion cannot snatch away its earnings and customers
Economies of scale
Switching costs: RTA business is sticky, if a mutual fund is being serviced by a particular RTA shifting to another RTA is difficult 
 as huge amount of data and information needs to be transferred and there is a high risk of disruption of operations and customer experience
Entry barriers: because of switching costs, also MF RTA business is technology intensive requiring continuous upgradation of 
 systems and processes in line with the increase in volumes and changing regulations, Investments in technology and branch expansion
 is justified only if volumes are adequate, hence a new players has to think twice before entering this space
Network Effect - 275 service centres across 25 states and 5 Union territories 

ii)PRICING POWER (MUST HAVE MOAT) - industry controlled (bargaining power of AMC customers)
volume-based pricing or the flabbiest pricing will ensure that going forward yield will keep falling down as the assets grow and 
 that needs to be managed

----Capital Allocation 
//SOURCE OF CAPITAL - mostly Retained Earnings

---USE OF NEW/INCREMENTAL CAPITAL : A good company always uses capital for achieving operating efficiency or focus on next phase
 growth and not for survival (like expenses , capex maintenance etc) - if it uses for survival then it is capital intensive business
Inorganic growth - M&A for strategic purpose or to build a MOAT
Dividends(Mostly) - most mature companies give out dividends as they don't find better oppurtunities to re-invest profits
modernising or technology upgradation of operations
MOAT building or repairing or strengthening (so that earnings are not snatched by someone)


//RETURN ON CAPITAL
Ideal company : if it can redeploy the incremental capital for same/high returns over time - it becomes a compounding machine


// SUMMARY (Business Quality Check) - decided by PAST, PRESENT and FUTURE of the company
  -Predictable and consistent/recurring EARNINGS for next 10 yrs(MOATS, pricing power)
  -non-cyclical - shallow cyclical (during recession inflows might decrease)
  -lousy industry/niche industry(no big players have entered yet)
  -not completely recession proof (don't make it frontrunner of ur portfolio)
  -Superior economics (what does company produce, target audience and how does it produce): ESG Principles
   Environmental: does the process/products cause any kind of pollution
   Social: does the products/services add some value to customers or do they waste their time or money or destroy their health
   Governance: Superior Management and board of directors
  -Not a Scalable business model globally
  -Having Tailwinds
  -If a person has lot of money can he break ur business and take away marketshare? NO bcoz of moats
  -Ideal business always takes little amount of capital to operate and an excellent business always
    earns same high returns on incremental capital

promoters: shareholding decreasing over the years
no related party transactions

----------------------------------- RISKS ----------------------------------------
check Risk_Check.txt
---Business Risk:
Directly linked to Stock markets and AMCs
Top 5 clients contributed to 68% of revenues in FY20. Client concentration risk is high, even if 1 client were to move to another 
  player, revenues will be impacted - company is significantly focusing on non-mf revenues as well
Revenues are dependent on AAUM of mutual funds especially equity AUMs, if AAUM managed were to decline due to tough market conditions, 
 revenues of CAMS will be impacted
Regulatory risk - Regulations impacting mutual funds will impact the RTAs. For instance the latest regulation of capping 
 expense ratios for AMCs will impact RTAs (clients pay CAMS from expense ratio money)
pricing power risk - bargaining power of AMC customers union
Company handles confidential data – personal and financial information of clients. Any breach of their systems will create legal 
  and regulatory risk

---Financial Risk: None

---Management Risk:

---Investment Returns Risk: None

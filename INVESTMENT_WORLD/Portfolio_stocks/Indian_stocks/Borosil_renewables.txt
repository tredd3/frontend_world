any research report/youtube analysis available for the company: 
what peter lynch bucket does stock belongs to : slow growers/stalwarts/fast growers/cyclicals/asset heavy/turover(special situation)


--------------------- PRESENT --------------------
---Sectoral analysis:
//STAGE of development:
pioneering - green energy
//Sector value chain : from sourcing to sales entire process and businesses involved must be known (you should always pick companies 
at profitable end of value chain), demand and supply (size of opportunity)
//Market size/Oppurtunity or possible demand for the Sector: it is not about how big a company is, it is about how big a company can get
   only within the country :
        limited to few businesses/limited customer usage
        not limited to a single user (almost every user will find its usage now or eventually)
        not limited to single business (almost every business will find its usage now or eventually)
   global oppurtunity/exports :
        limited to few businesses/limited customer usage
        not limited to a single user (almost every user will find its usage now or eventually)
        not limited to single business (almost every business will find its usage now or eventually)

---Products/services DEMAND check :
//From where does the actual demand from for the company? 
  B2B - from module and PV manufacturers
  Global - exports

//Type of demand
    continous and growing demand 
    Transitionory Demand 

//Capturing sector demand Oppurtunities:
sector demand is growing and it is the only player in india


---Products/services SUPPLY check :
1)Product portfolio :
High Performance Solar Glass for 
• solar PV
• High Performance Green House
• Solar Rooftop, Water pumps
• Solar Thermal projects
• Bifacial - using two glasses in each module as against one in the case a conventional module and as a result, there is a shift
 in favor of thinner glass of 2mm globally. 
• Borosil Solar Glass with low Antimony content
• NoSbEra: Borosil Solar Glass – without Antimony(patented technology) - Borosil is the only solar glass manufacturer in the world
 who has been able to successfully remove the Antimony(toxic element) from Solar glass
Value added products:
Recently developed a solar glass with matt finish on both sides - Transmission value reaching higher than 94% with use of an 
  appropriate AR Coating
SELENE” ANTI-GLARE SOLAR GLASS FOR PV PROJECTS NEAR AIRPORTS - Reflection/ glare from the PV modules installed near Airports may
interfere pilot or airport staff’s visibility. 

//In order to achieve the optimum module weight, the Solar PV market is moving towards use of thinner glass
World’s 1st fully tempered thinnest Solar Glass for versatility and longevity - Reduces the overall weight of the module leading to
Project Cost Optimization, Offers Superior Edge-to-Edge sealing increasing module lifetime (up to 40 years), strength & reliability.
Applications of thinner glass : Floating PV, Frameless Modules, Bifacial and  Glass-glass modules


2)COMPETETION :  none in india
  global competettion - low cost imports risk from china any Malasiya
  threat of new entrants - none in the near term as getting in to this space needs an R&D of atleast 5-6 yrs and by then borosil 
     might have gotten that brand name and first mover adavantage with huge market share


3)Listed peers Comparison: no peers


4)Products/services Uniqueness and Quality check :
what makes the product or service of this company Unique?
 ENGINEERED FOR LONG TERM DURABILITY, safe and strong

------------------- FUTURE -----------------
---Goal/Aim that the company wants to achieve and what is the Strategy that it wants to employ?
//Goal/Aim - global leader, capture market share from unorganised players, cleanup stuff and become efficient etc
//Strategies being employed: 
ideally a company that clones other successful strategies is almost bound to win provided it has other necessary qualifications


--- EARNING POWER (Earnings Growth Oppurtunities check )
//SOURCE OF EARNINGS
--Internal Growth oppurtunities
capex - 5 times increase by FY24 (from 450 TPD to 2100 TPD)
TPD - tons per day
--External Growth oppurtunities
Macroeconomic: 14 Gigawatts of solar module manufacturing capacity exists
in India, actual production was about 5.5 Gigawatts during the financial year 2021. We see
installed capacity rising to 50 Gigawatts of solar panels within the next three year
Tailwinds:
Lot of Govt support
Exports - A very good potential to increase exports to Europe, Americas, Russia, Turkey and MENA due to renewed focus on domestic
  modules manufacturing in Solar PV 

---- Sustainability of Earning power: MOATS and Pricing Power to make it a long term bet
1)Competettive advantage/MOAT Check?
Economises of Scale
Low cost producer
Brand
Taste
Network effect
Intangible assets
Switching costs
Entry barriers
Luxury/Premium Range

2)PRICING POWER (MUST HAVE MOAT)

3) Longterm vs short term bet
/Preferred Investment: Both MOATS and Earnings Growth oppurtunities need to exist for sustainable Earnings
/Company with No Moats  but very high growth oppurtunities - a short term buy becuase other competetiors with MOATS can take away the
market share soon - need to monitor closely
/Company with good MOATS but not very good growth oppurtunities - it has become a slow grower(if they genrate a stable free cashflow
you can use the cash to buy other growth and non-growth businesses) 
Note: Don't forget to compare dividend yield with FD interest rates


----Capital Allocation 
//SOURCE OF CAPITAL - Debt/Retained Earnings/New Equity


//USE OF NEW/INCREMENTAL CAPITAL : A good company always uses capital for progressing and next phase growth and not for survival 
Cash
Organic growth - putting back the money in the same business
Inorganic growth - M&A
Dividends
Buyback - preferred
Capex - new
Capex - old PLANT/MACHINERY maintainance (this can't be for ever year meaning sustainence capex is bad for the company)
modernising or technology upgradation of operations
R&D
Advertising
Working capital (tied up in) - bad


//RETURN ON CAPITAL
Good company: ROCE/ROIC(return on capital) > WACC (cost of cpital)
Very Good company: ROCE/ROIC(return on capital) >>> WACC (cost of cpital)
Ideal company : if it can redeploy the incremental capital for same/high returns over time - it becomes a compounding machine

// SUMMARY (Business Quality Check) - decided by PAST, PRESENT and FUTURE of the company
  -Predictable and consistent/recurring EARNINGS for next 10 yrs(MOATS, pricing power)
  -Competes on value rather than price bcoz company that competes on value is like a magnet with stronger magnetic field  that
    attracts customers and companies which compete on price will lose their business to competetiors
  -prefer high margin non commoditized business - if commoditized then must be a low cost producer
  -lousy industry/highly competettive industry/niche industry(no big players have entered yet) ?
  -proxy play on some capital intensive/debt heavy/lousy industry ? 
  -Superior economics (what does company produce, target audience and how does it produce): ESG Principles
   Environmental: does the process/products cause any kind of pollution
   Social: does the products/services add some value to customers or do they waste their time or money or destroy their health
   Governance: Superior Management and board of directors
  -Scalable business model - globally preferred (mutibagger are made because of this property)
  -Company having calibre or potential to adapt to the changing business environment - having said that invest 
    in a business with slow rate of change, rapid change is the enemy of an investor as it needs more capital to adapt and 
    burns more cash to be in the competettion)
  -Having Tailwinds is an added advantage as it boosts the process of wealth creation and helps u in achieving goal faster

//how is the Management and their Vision: growth vision
Corporate Governance: A professionally managed business backed up by family

----------------------------------- RISKS ----------------------------------------
check Risk_Check.txt
---Business Risk:
1)demand is mostly linked to demand of module manufacturing in the country - Recent announcements by various Module Manufacturers/
  Solar Plant Developers to add 37 GW of module manufacturing capacity taking the same to about 50 GW over next 3 years
2)The government of India has been protecting the domestic manufacturers through anti-dumping duty and countervailing duty on imports.
 Hence, any change in the current policy or increase in supply by importers, could impact BRL’s turnover and profitability.
Even if govt removes both the rules - Present domestic demand > BRL’s post-expansion capacity, robust growth in the sector in domestic
 manufacturing of modules, current high share of imports and high growth in exports = Easy absorption of additional production volumes

---Management Risk:

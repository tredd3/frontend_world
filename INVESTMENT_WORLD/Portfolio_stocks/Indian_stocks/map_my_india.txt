what peter lynch bucket does stock belongs to : slow growers/stalwarts/fast growers/cyclicals/asset heavy/turover(special situation)


2)PRESENT :
---Sectoral analysis: niche sector 

---Products/services DEMAND check : almost every industry today needs map Services
Automotive: navigation and maps in 2W, PV, CV - also self driven cars need accurate location data 
Food delivery: address intelligence, last mile delivery tracking
E-commerce: long haul first mile and last mile delivery tracking;
Drone services: fly zone data, accurate and precise location data
Healthcare and Pharma: distribution and logistics of medical goods, indoor mapping of plants, GPS tracking for ambulance
BFSI: geo verification and onboarding, usage based auto insurance, geo CRM for sales, claims and collection agents;
Retail and QSR: location enabled online e-commerce, location based digital advertising
Telecom and Utilities: field force monitoring, optical fibre mapping and distribution analytics;
Transportation and Logistics: fleet and asset tracking, transportation data, truck routing solutions, driver safety, route risk assessment;
Government: Geo tagging of public assets for repair and overhaul; for example, gas pipeline, water pipeline; emergency response, smart city, taxation;
Railways and waterways: network and route mapping; tracking of fleet
Forest department: geo tagging and digital mapping

---Products/services SUPPLY check :
Company services:
  i)The maps are generated in 2D, 3D, 4D and HD and are updated using AI and analytics. They not just show the traffic but also show the safety
  ii)data collected from multiple sources , including ISRO satellite images => analytics on data => represent them on digital map
  large amount of the map dataset is proprietary - the company has built comprehensive, accurate and feature enriched map datasets.
  These maps are professionally curated, continuously updated and used in navigation, telematics and location based services. 
  iii)granular/precise data useful for hyperlocal navigation and continous update of data
  iv)RealView is India’s first and only Street Imagery Service, captured by high end cameras , businesses and govt can use this data
   for analysing and decision making
  v)HD maps create a 3D view of their environment that are accurate at a centimetre level - Specifically designed for self-driving 
    cars, we offer comprehensive, accurate and updated HD maps. 
  vi)workmate - location based employee tracking, work assignment and management
--- Products/services Uniqueness check :
what makes the product or service of this company Unique?
1)We use Google maps to see the distance and traffic. But, MapmyIndia has demographic data which can be used by the likes of Zomato 
  to get a better sense of no of employees to be recruited in a given area based on demography or by banks to understand where to open ATMs.
  Note: Demographic information examples include: age, race, ethnicity, gender, marital status, income, education, and employment. 
2)Google is a giant. It is into many businesses including autos. Obviously, Hyundai and MG Hector won’t use Google Maps as they
   perceive Google as a threat. Here comes MapmyIndia in picture
3) provides more granularity details of location which is used for hyperlocal navigation(door delivery in remote areas) - this is
 in collaboration with ISRO , since MapmyIndia is a Indian origin company they have the previlege to access the data, unlike 
 Google with which ISRO might not share the data bcoz of security issues

3)FUTURE :
---Process/Strategy check?
--- Sustainabile Growth of Earnings check (Moats and Growth oppurtunities)
//Growth oppurtunities
1)Macroeconomic:
 huge addressable market (47000 cr as per Frost and Sullivan's report)
2)Internal:
3)Tailwinds: 
//Moats:
Economises of Scale - high operating leverage , any new client addition contributions will go staright to PAT
Trust - People won't trust Google as it advertises the data, whereas MapmyIndia claims that it never use data of
    customer and maintains the confidentiality!
Entry barriers for global players - due to confidentiality of data
foreign entities are restricted due to vehicle based or street view surveys, acquiring, re-selling granular geospatial data and 
 restricting the data to pass through their severs. Hence indian entities becomes a preffered player
Entry barriers for new entrants - MapmyIndia has built proprietary technology over 25 years and built ground validated geospatial 
 databases of large countries like India may be difficult to replicate by a new entrant in a short period of time.
---PRICING POWER (MUST HAVE MOAT)
---EARNING POWER 


// SUMMARY (Business Quality Check) - decided by PAST, PRESENT and FUTURE of the company
  -Predictable and consistent/recurring EARNINGS for next 10 yrs(MOATS, pricing power)
  -Competes on value rather than price bcoz company that competes on value is like a magnet with stronger magnetic field  that
    attracts customers and companies which compete on price will lose their business to competetiors
  -prefer high margin non commoditized business - if commoditized then must be a low cost producer
  -lousy industry/highly competettive industry/niche industry(no big players have entered yet) - mix of lousy and niche industry
  -proxy play on some capital intensive/debt heavy/lousy industry ? Yes on Auto and logistics, e-commerce, online delivery etc
   very imp to check the competetiors and the uniqueness of the company bcoz if it is in highly competettive industry with no
   uniqueness it will not have pricing power as well and can easily lose business to competetiors, bcoz the customers of the 
   current company want to cut costs and hence they will choose competetiors providing business for less value
  -Superior economics (what does company produce, target audience and how does it produce): ESG Principles
   Environmental: does the process/products cause any kind of pollution
   Social: does the products/services add some value to customers or do they waste their time or money or destroy their health
   Governance: Superior Management and board of directors
  -Scalable business model - globally preferred (mutibagger are made because of this property)
  -Company having calibre or potential to adapt to the changing business environment - having said that invest 
    in a business with slow rate of change, rapid change is the enemy of an investor as it needs more capital to adapt and 
    burns more cash to be in the competettion)
  -Having Tailwinds is an added advantage as it boosts the process of wealth creation and helps u in achieving goal faster


------------------------------ FINANCIAL STRENGTH CHECK --------------------------
check Financial_Strength_Check.txt
//Financial strengths 
 operating leverage(the cost of collecting, updating and analysing data is fixed)
//Financial weakness
 significant other income compared to operating profit

------------------------------ MANAGEMENT CHECK --------------------------------
Longterm Vision: MapmyIndia is working towards solving the unstructured address system with Digital Addressing system called 
  eLocation, will become the backbone of the location-based solution. The vision is to move from 2D/3D maps based solutions to 
  a real-time Digital Twin of the country.
Skillset: Promoters have good technical and management background (IITs and foreign MBAs)


----------------------------------- RISKS ----------------------------------------
check Risk_Check.txt
---Business Risk:
1)high concentration of automotive clients
2)The entire geospatial space was liberalized by govt This will cause more competition in future
New Indian players can enter in to this but lot of data gathering is involved - so we need to keep monitor this space
any company that can collect comprehensive and accurate data and develop better systems to present 
it on maps can win : but this just web mapping and MapmyIndia is offering other services too
There are roughly 100 companies that are in to map/location related services - but there is no strong competetior to mapmy india 
  interms of holistic range of services they provide
3)MapymyIndia services can be replaced by other company services if proven better - As maympindia makes other companies efficient
you need to track its clients for investing oppurtunities and see if they are streamlining their Operations and becoming more efficient
4)unpredictable: addressable market is huge, they have a first mover advantage but customers need to be educated to use mapymyindia
  which means there is still a longway to go. if competetior comes in at some later point he can capture the market and take away
  market share just like PAYTM bust.However unlike PAYTM, Maymyindia is not burning cash to acquire customers - it is burning cash on 
  technology upgrades which adds value to customers and attract them more
5)cybersecurity risk: as all the operations are data based

---Financial Risk:
Consistent R&D is required to keep with tech changes and innovate, any laxness on this end will cause damage to existing customer relationships.
continous Investments on technology to make it more competettive

---Management Risk:
CTO is a chemical engineer - whereas company is using all the latest technologies


---Investment Returns Risk:

Tyre bead wire is high carbon bronze coated steel wire used in all kinds of automobile tyres, tyres of earth moving
equipments and aircrafts. The main function of bead wire is to hold the tyre on the rim and bead is the crucial link through 
which the vehicle load is transferred from rim to the tyre. It significantly affects the safety, strength and the durability of tyres.
Besides bead wire, we also produce high carbon steel wire and uncoated wires of varying specifications for different applications


Entry barriers
Switching costs - Since Approval takes time, Its mostly sticky
Pricing power - only 3% cost of Manufacturing Tyres goes to Rajratan - given its importance , any price increase shouldn't matter
 much to OEM's

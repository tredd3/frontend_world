------------------- SCREENING SUMMARY -------------------
//General check:
  stock picking strategy: saurabh mukherjee portfolio
  Normal check on stock price since inception - google search (any abnormal increase or decrease in share price?)
  legal orders(confirm from wiki) and tickertape
  corporate actions, dividend history and announcements from tickertape
  check shareholding pattern(especially promoter) trend over the years in tijori
    Promoter holding : 44%
    Institutional ownership: 20%
  promoter pledging: None
  Is the business easy to understand or complex : easy
  circle of competence: Yes/No
  any recent insider buying (bse india > disclosures > insider trading) OR Value Research(ownership section) for US stocks
  (Especially if normal employees are buying apart form promoters/top management then its a positive sign as they know better
     than any broker/analyst/investor)
  any bulk or block deals (to discover price?

//Business check:
  market share trend: In four-wheelers, its market share has increased from 20 percent to 35 percent in the last five years.
  //how is the quality of product/service - Good almost all top OEMs are its customers
  CRISIL Rating must be Above A and check Rating History for last 3 Years - AA stable
  open RHP for complete information and risks (if a company is recently listed then this must)
  can a fool run this business
  can you put 50% of your net worth, buy the whole business and forget about it for next 5-10 yrs ???
   assuming that stock market is closed for next 5-10yrs are you ok holding the entire business without knowing its price every year?
  for longterm : don't invest in a stock just bcoz the stock price will increase, invest because you want to own that business

//Finance check:
1)Balance sheet Strength check
--Equity/Total assets (liabilities should be as less as possible for a strong balance sheet) 60%
--(Price to book value) - 5 (not an asset play)

//non-current assets - 620 
Net block

//Net current assets - 600

//shareholder Equity - 1084
--Check Equity CAGR from balance sheet equity section - 23%
   ROE 16%
--Sorce of Equity increase: to find this out balance sheet should be studied in tally with cash flow statement
 Sustainable:  cash flow from operations(goes in to retained earnings) 

//non-current Liabilities - 100

2)Profit and loss statement: Good
  
3)Cashflow statement: clean

4)Profitability Ratios Check:
--OPM 16%
--NPM 8%
Note: if NPM is less then check Asset turnover ratio, if both are less than ROE is less and you need to avoid that business
--ROE & ROCE 16%

//Valuation check - Tijori finance valuation
Price is different Valuation is different, just bcoz stock is falling doesn't mean it is cheap(earnings might be falling too)
Price - is what people pay for the business
Valuation is price compared to earnings 
Note: Don't invest in a stock because the price has fallen and you think the price will increase , own the stock because you 
 understand that business(circle of competence) , believe in its future(i.e predictability and earning power) and it 
 is available at lower valuations (absolute(DCF) and relative, with more focus on absolute)

--EV/OCF(Market cap + debt - cash&cash equivalents)/operating cash flow - 20
--PEG: 3.83
--DCF: 10% earnings CAGR for 10 yrs at MCAP 4700 cr
--check tickertape and  morning star for valuation confirmation - fair price 421

any research report/youtube analysis available for the company: 
what peter lynch bucket does stock belongs to : slow growers/stalwarts/fast growers/cyclicals/asset heavy/turover(special situation)
Note: Categories of Stock: 
  1)slow growers(HUL,Dabur) - highly mature, revenue growth 1-5% inline with GDP growth or even lesser
  2)stalwarts - 10-15% revenue growth (TataElixi, IEX)
  3)Fast Growers (Praj)
  4)cyclicals(Auto industry, Travel)
  5)Asset heavy(most of the PSUs)
  6)Turnarounds(Tata consumer products, NBCC,IDFC First bank) - raising from RIP to star 

--------------------- PRESENT --------------------
---Sectoral analysis: 
avoid investing in highly regulated sectors, sectors linked significantly to commodity prices and sectors exposed to technological disruption.
//STAGE of development:
pioneering - EV, green energy
growth - internet
maturity/saturation - FMCG
declining - obselete - TV channels, print media

//Sector value chain : from sourcing to sales entire process and businesses involved must be known (you should always pick companies 
at profitable end of value chain), demand and supply (size of opportunity)

//Market size/Oppurtunity or possible demand for the Sector: it is not about how big a company is, it is about how big a company can get
   only within the country :
        limited to few businesses/limited customer usage
        not limited to a single user (almost every user will find its usage now or eventually)
        not limited to single business (almost every business will find its usage now or eventually)
   global oppurtunity/exports :
        limited to few businesses/limited customer usage
        not limited to a single user (almost every user will find its usage now or eventually)
        not limited to single business (almost every business will find its usage now or eventually)

---Products/services DEMAND check :
//From where does the actual demand from for the company? 
  B2B (client diversification, strong order book - must be volume led growth)
  B2C (how many users out of 140 cr population use it)
  Business service companies (what all industries/companies need it)
  Government
  Global - from which all countries demand come from

//Type of demand
    continous and growing demand - volume led growth reaching to larger audience or more consumption(personal care, healthcare, 
       insurance, real estate, Energy,Banking and finance, Investments)
    continous and replacement/upgradation demand based on latest trends/depreciation - value addition (clothing and footwear, 
        Electronics, Automobile,home furnishing)
    continous and constant/slow growth demand(FMCG, Food, Telecommunication) - volume growth and pricing power play
    one time demand(capital goods) then growth oppurtunities size should be vast like Praj.Even though Praj establishes the ethanol
     plant, it has huge oppurtunity abroad/huge order backlog both domestic and abroad
    Transition Demand - EV, Renewable Energy, 5G, New Technology - need a lot of research as it can make or break your portfolio
      bcoz of high competettion given the size of oppurtunity


---Products/services SUPPLY check :
1)Product portfolio - what all products company manufactures (you can find in investor presentation) - check revenue contribution 
  of each product
Note: if you are investing in this company only because of a specific product like chawyan prash(dabur), Royal enfield(Eicher) etc
always check wt % revenues are contributed by that product (for Eicher RE contributes around 90% revenues so it can be a buy based
 on further analysis but Dabur cannot be a buy based on chawayan prash because it contibutes < 10% to revenue)
e.g: tatva chintan has a huge portfolio and electrolytic salts to be used in EV is roughly 5% of their portfolio - so don't invest
  only based on EV exposure


2)COMPETETION :  Never look for companies that doesn't have competetion, always prefer companies that sustained competettion with their 
             MOATS bcoz someday or the other competettion is bound to come if it is a high margin business. At the same time Never 
             invest in a business that is present in a highly competettive industry that competes ONLY on price instead of value
  what is the unlisted players market share - 
  listed peers market share -
  postion among peers - 
  global competettion - imports risk from china or any other low cost producer country?
  threat of new entrants
Note: 
 if a business is extremely profitable then it attracts lot of capital , hence taking away gains/market share (so MOAT check is imp)
 if a business is dull/not profitable then lot of competettion goes away => current company that survives or control expenses will 
   keep gaining market share and eventually turns profitable (keep an eye)

3)Listed peers Comparison: tijori(benchmark) and screener peer comparison sections for profitability and costs
how do peers provide competetion : strong moats/geographical expansion/innovative products/capex spending
Pro Tip: if all Peers are equally profitable and equally effecient then low WC/sales(less capital needed to generate sales) and
  low CCC(less time taken to generate profits) is preferred

4)Products/services Uniqueness and Quality check :
what makes the product or service of this company Unique?
  //does it delight the customers - when they don't find that product in a store will they go across the street to get it
  //does it own consumers mind(i.e people always remember this company when u talk about a specific product like drink,burger,choc etc)
  //what value does it add to customers compared to competetiors?
  //how is the quality of product/service - Have u used the product/service ? 
    if YES, what is your view 
    if NO, go and open their website, check public review in ecommerce or google search


------------------- FUTURE -----------------
---Goal/Aim that the company wants to achieve and what is the Strategy that it wants to employ?
//Goal/Aim - global leader, capture market share from unorganised players, cleanup stuff and become efficient etc
//Strategies being employed: 
ideally a company that clones other successful strategies is almost bound to win provided it has other necessary qualifications


--- EARNING POWER 
Earning Power is the ability of the company to grow or compound its earnings every year for a very longtime 

1)SOURCE OF EARNINGS (Earnings Growth Oppurtunities check )
earnings source is more than earnings itself bcoz earnings source decides whether the earning growth is sustainable or not, 
  i.e it decides quality of earnings

i)INTERNAL GROWTH OPPURTUNITIES
///Sales Growth led Earnings Growth(every firm needs this kind of growth)     
  1)Demand/Consumption led growth from NEW customers (Volume led growth)
    /snatch market share - from unorganiesd
    /Global expansion/ exports - After the acquisition, the company will have three more manufacturing plants in Mexico, Hungary and China.
    /Strong Order inflows (only for B2B companies) - revenue contribution from EVs is expected to rise to nearly 22% in the next three years compared with 5% currently.
    /Demand shift from other countries like (china+1 startegy, supplychain disruption in other countries,for low cost substitution
       products etc - but be careful here as they can move from India to someother country too) 
  2)Demand/Consumption led growth from OLD customers (Volume led growth)
    /increased consumption(volume led growth) - cutomers buy more of the current/old products
    /Launch New products - Suprajitâ€™s existing business has a stronger position in body and door cables, while the acquired business has a higher share of revenue from seat cables.     
  3)ONLY Price led Growth (Not preferred at all) - slow growers(very large and matured companies)
    Check Volume growth in investor presentation/Annual report to find this out
    /Increase the price of old product, but increase in volume -  if volumes don't increase after some years your company earnings
    growth rate = inflation(6%) and in the long run as the stock price depends ONLY on earnings, it will also grow at 6%, meaning ur 
    money also grows at 6% and the purpose of investing in stock markets to beat infalation is gone. Also if sales are not increasing 
    then demand has dried up OR competetiors taking away market share - Both are bad situations

///Efficiency led Earnings Growth(few firms have achieved it, they just need to maintain)
    /promoter OR management change
    /cost cutting(cannot cut cost beyond a certain point) - increasing operating efficiency and hence margins
    //spending on technology for achieving efficiency and modernising the workflow or processes
    /spin off - dispose losing operations (increases firm efficiency by increasing management focus)
    /process optimisation and innovation - chemicals and pharma mainly
    /Reduce debt - look at D/E trend over 10yrs and Debt/Profit should be less than 5
    NOTE: This form of growth will increase profitability of the firm in the short term, but a company cannot become efficient 
    after a certain point(even though it can maintain that efficiency) hence for the profitability to sustain in the longterm this
    needs to be augumented by Demand/consumption led growth either from New or Old customers(Preferably from new customers)
    But in the journey of company becoming efficient you can make huge profits and hence always check whether management is focusing
    on making the firm efficient or not apart from focusing on sales

ii)EXTERNAL: GROWTH OPPURTUNITIES
  /cloning other great company strategies
  /Acquistion and synergy led growth - acquiring the light duty cable (LDC) division of a Norway based company, Kongsberg - opening 
    the doors for cross selling as most of the customers of Kongsberg are not the customers of Suprajit
  /vertical integration - zero dependence on others, high avialbility, cost advantage and quality control e.g: Apple, Amazon
  /backward or forward integration
  /Macroeconomic oppurtunity
  -only 6% houselholds in india have cars, leaving huge room for growth
  -transitionary demand to EVs
  /Tailwinds - china+1, russia Ukrain War etc

Note: Internal growth is always preferred but sometimes the business size is so big that the size of internal growth oppurtunity 
   seems trivial and we need to opt for external growth. 
   for e.g: let us say if HUL identifies an internal growth oppurtunity that can increase its cash flow by 20% , however if HUL 
   opts and invests the capital in external growth oppurtunity instead, say acquisition then its cashflow grows by 50% then it
   is a no brainer to allocate capital for external growth opportunity by the Management


2)Sustainability of Earnings: MOATS and Pricing Power to make it a long term bet
i)Competettive advantage/MOAT Check? check MOATS_check.txt
MOAT - is the trait or quality that a business has bcoz of which competettion cannot snatch away its earnings and customers
Note: do not invest in businesses whose moats are primarily driven by regulations and political linkages.
Economises of Scale
Low cost producer - check product quality and profitability ratios
Brand - must be accompained with pricing power
Taste
Network effect
Intangible assets
Switching costs
Entry barriers
Luxury/Premium Range
Monopoly/Duopoly(monopoly might not create wealth everytime be careful with these companies if a competettion comes in and 
   takes away the profit they will bust you However that doesn't happen overnight, it will be gradually reflected in the earnings
   so doing an annual review should catch these stuff)
   -if market size is less then the monopoly companies might face price heat from other smaller companies
   -All monopoly companies earnings growth rate == sector/industry growth rate (hence sector/industry analysis becomes extremely
    important)

Note: Does MOAT Exists? 
  if yes is the MOAT durable, i.e can the company keep its DCA nature for next 10 yrs OR will competetiors snatch away 
   the profits? Imagine and think with a calm mind where do you see this company in the next 10 yrs,
   take in to account, facts and reasoning not opinion
  if NO MOAT what is the 10 yr picture u have in ur mind? will it build one?

ii)PRICING POWER (MUST HAVE MOAT)- can the company be able to sustain in recession, inflation, supply chain disruption situations
   or another company specific costs where the prices of everything would have gone up. During these unforseen situations company
   might not make profits but atleast it shouldn't do business in losses
Pricing power implies people are willing to pay premium (can the company increase the product/services prices in the cases
 like inflation and supply chain disruption or in general and be sure that people still buy their products and they don't loose their 
 business to competettion) 
 Proof: if costs increase then sales must increase and GPM trend is either stable or upwards(tijori) 
 This will happen only when :
   i)The product or service is unique and there is hardly any substitute
   ii)NO bargaining power of suppliers: suppliers shouldn't have more bargaining power, if they have then better to own the supplier stocks
     Bargining power of suppliers(low or -ve accounts payable) - critical parts/services suppliers, ONLY producer/supplier of certain products
     Bargining power of company(-ve working capital) - bulk and recurring buy, company with MOATS (as the demand is sustainable)
    Note: Account payables is high meaning company having bargaining power
   iii)NO bargaining power of buyers :
     Bargaining power of buyers(higher inventory days as people always look for bargain in other places, high account recievables as
     the company needs to give the product on credit ) - if client base is limited then company doesn't have a choice but to sell 
     the products at a lower price, if the buyer demands so, especially true for B2B suppliers 
     OR if a company in a highly competettive business (e-commerce, airlines) where people never want to pay premium OR if the 
     product is a commodity (then people always look for low price as value is same across producers)

Note: Pricing power is must for capex heavy companies(high fixed cost or operating leverage) companies with large amounts of
 debt - otherwise they can go Bankruptcy and destroy shareholder's wealth during recession.

Thesis :
/Longterm Investment: Both MOATS and Earnings Growth oppurtunities exists
/Shorterm Investment: Company with No Moats  but very high growth oppurtunities - a short term buy becuase other competetiors 
 with MOATS can take away the market share soon - need to monitor closely
/Company with good MOATS but not very good growth oppurtunities - it has become a slow grower(if they genrate a stable free cashflow
you can use the cash to buy other growth and non-growth businesses) 
Note: Don't forget to compare dividend yield with FD interest rates


----Capital Allocation 
//SOURCE OF CAPITAL - Debt/Retained Earnings/New Equity
EPS = Net Income(earnings)/Total Shares outstanding
1)RETAINED EARNINGS(cheapest and most preferred) - i.e reinvest free cashflow generated by the company
+ve scenario: Earnings increase => EPS increases => share price increases
-ve scenario: you will lose Reserves, but your Earnings will remain same => EPS remains same => share price remains constant
most importantly it doesn't have to pay any interest , also the total number of shares outstanding doesn't change
Hence a company needs to do some experimentation with the products/geography or try something new it is preferred to use 
RETAINED EARNINGS by generating more operating cash
2)DEBT(next preference)
+ve scenario: Earnings increase => debt repaid => after repayment whatever company acquired using debt(brand value, building, plant 
  and machinery) will remian with the company and fetch cash forever
-ve scenario: if debt levels are very high and Earnings decrease => company need to sell assets and repay debt => Bankruptcy
3)NEW EQUITY(EPS will decrease) - ESOPs, Preferential issue, QIP, Private placement etc
+ve scenario: new equity raised is used in the best way possible (reinvesting in own buiness/M&A) => Earnings increase => EPS increase
  and hence share price increases
-ve scenario: Earnings decrease and Total Shares outstanding increases, EPS drastcically goes down and hence stock will be overvalued
  taking share prices down bcoz of massive selling


---USE OF NEW/INCREMENTAL CAPITAL : A good company always uses capital for achieving operating efficiency or focus on next phase
 growth and not for survival (like expenses , capex maintenance etc) - if it uses for survival then it is capital intensive business
Cash - waiting for oppurtunities
Organic growth - putting back the money in the same business like meaningful expenses provided you maintain your return ratios(ROE/ROCE/ROIC)
Inorganic growth - M&A for strategic purpose or to build a MOAT
Dividends - most mature companies give out dividends as they don't find better oppurtunities to re-invest profits
Buyback - preferred
Capex - new
Capex - old PLANT/MACHINERY maintainance (this can't be for ever year meaning sustainence capex is bad for the company)
modernising or technology upgradation of operations
R&D - for future business but the amount spent has to be monitored
Advertising - brand building and awareness activity but the amount spent has to be monitored, along with sales growth
Working capital (tied up in) - bad
MOAT building or repairing or strengthening (so that earnings are not snatched by someone)


//RETURN ON CAPITAL
https://goodcalculators.com/wacc-calculator/
why Return on Capital is important?
Over the longterm the investment returns will always resemble the capital returns

Avg company : ROIC/ROCE ~= WACC and Capital is increasing and ROCE is decreasing (assuming there is no ongoing capex or money locked
  in other activities)
Good company: ROCE/ROIC(return on capital) > WACC (cost of cpital) and 
either ROCE is increasing and capital is constant OR Capital is increasing and ROCE is constant
Ideal company : if it can redeploy the incremental capital for same/high returns over time - it becomes a compounding machine
i.e both ROCE and capital is increasing

// SUMMARY (Business Quality Check) - decided by PAST, PRESENT and FUTURE of the company
  -Ideal business: Yes/No
   always takes little amount of capital to operate and an excellent business always earns same high returns on incremental capital

   POSITIVES:
  -Superior economics (what does company produce, target audience and how does it produce): ESG Principles
   Environmental: does the process/products cause any kind of pollution
   Social: does the products/services add some value to customers or do they waste their time or money or destroy their health
   Governance: Superior Management and board of directors
  -Predictable and consistent EARNINGS for next 10 yrs(sticky and recurring)
  -Repeat business - people need to keep buying it to survive/daily needs 
  -Platform/Infrastucture Business(Indiamart, IEX, Amazon, Delhivery) - (MOAT: Economies of scale, Switching cost, Distribution network)
  -Competes on value rather than price bcoz company that competes on value is like a magnet with stronger magnetic field  that
    attracts customers and companies which compete on price will lose their business to competetiors
  -recession proof ? how did it perform in 2008 and 2020 crisis
    Note : high debt or high capex companies can go bust during recession or high inflatory situations(if no pricing power)
  -Scalable business model - globally preferred (mutibagger are made because of this property)
  -proxy play on some industry ? 
  -Lousy industriy Survivor: operating in boring/lousy industries where no one wants to enter or companies in that sector
   facing heavy loses and low profitability or no growth, hence the Survivor
  -niche/extreme niche - does something very specific which takes a lot of time to build (MOAT: entry barriers, switching cost)
  -deals with very sensitive sectors needing lot of approvals and gain client trust/confidence
  -Having Tailwinds is an added advantage as it boosts the process of wealth creation and helps u in achieving goal faster

  NEGATIVES:
  -dependent on govt OR Linked to Govt: Price controlled by Govt, Govt is the only Customer , Anti-dumping duty by Govt
  -non Predictable for next 5-10yrs
  -competes only on Price with very little value addition and attract via discounts like Food delivery, Paytm , Nykaa
  -not recession proof
  -commoditized business - if commoditized the it must be a low cost producer
  -cyclical - cyclical revenues and cashflows
  -highly competettive industry like Auto/Telecom/Aviation etc
  -Non scalable business Either bcoz of limited market size OR Global competettion
  -limited clients - Zero pricing power
  -CONTINOUSLY needs to add and upgrade capex to stay in business like infra comapnies (telecom, energy, airlines, utilities)
  -CONTINOUSLY needs to spend more money on R&D to stay in business like electronics, auto and pharma companies that spend heavily on R&D
  -If a person has lot of money he can break ur business and take away marketshare
  -diworsefication - enetering in to businesses or acquiring businesses that doesn't belong to the expertise level of the current 
  company 
  -Avoid serial Acquirers
  -B2B player that doesn't have pricing power because of high competettion, commoditised or no MOATs
  -lower end of value chain

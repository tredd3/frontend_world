what peter lynch bucket does stock belongs to : fast growers


2)PRESENT :
---Sectoral analysis:
largely unorganised Sector
mostly companies outsource mnufacturing
no player in india  has low cost production of product on scale 
almost all the players except relaxo has products for high end customers
for low end customers unorganised players 
---Products/services DEMAND check :
---Products/services SUPPLY check :
--- Products/services Uniqueness check :


3)FUTURE :
---Process/Strategy check?
--- Sustainabile Growth of Earnings check (Moats and Growth oppurtunities)
//Growth oppurtunities
1)Macroeconomic:
india has the largest youth population in the world and AUM as % of GDP is 12% , globally it is 63%
Equity AUM to GDP is 5% in india in the developed countries it is roughly 50%
only 5% of assets in india are financial assets - even if in the next 10 yrs it goes to 15% then CAMS business increases 5 times 
2)Internal:
Services to AMC, AIFs, Insurance firms in the GIFT City - Global investors can now invest in India via GIFT city smoothly
NPS CRA application and data on cloud (2 other players are Kfintech CRA, NSDL CRA) 
CAMSfinserv enables rapid, secure and consent-based sharing of financial asset information with the consent of customers(Account aggregator)
• For individuals - AA framework enables them to access and review their financial information in one place
• For Financial institutions and businesses - AA Framework brings together Financial information providers and financial information users to unlock the
value of customers financial information
Note: CAMSfinserv does not view, store or have any access to use the customers’ data - so no cybersecurity/fraud issues
3)Tailwinds: increase in disposable income, financial awareness, ease of investment at low cost, traditional investments(like FD)
 not able to beat inflation etc
//Moats:
Switching costs: RTA business is sticky, if a mutual fund is being serviced by a particular RTA shifting to another RTA is difficult 
 as huge amount of data and information needs to be transferred and there is a high risk of disruption of operations and customer experience
Entry barriers: because of switching costs, also MF RTA business is technology intensive requiring continuous upgradation of 
 systems and processes in line with the increase in volumes and changing regulations, Investments in technology and branch expansion
 is justified only if volumes are adequate, hence a new players has to think twice before entering this space

----------------------------------- RISKS ----------------------------------------
check Risk_Check.txt
---Business Risk:
Directly linked to Stock markets and AMCs
Revenues are dependent on AAUM of mutual funds especially equity AUMs, if AAUM managed were to decline due to tough market conditions, 
 revenues of CAMS will be impacted
Top 5 clients contributed to 68% of revenues in FY20. Client concentration risk is high, even if 1 client were to move to another 
  player, revenues will be impacted
Regulations impacting mutual funds will impact the RTAs. For instance the latest regulation of capping expense ratios for
  AMCs will impact RTAs
Company handles confidential data – personal and financial information of clients. Any breach of their systems will create legal 
  and regulatory risk

---Financial Risk: None


---Management Risk:

---Investment Returns Risk: None

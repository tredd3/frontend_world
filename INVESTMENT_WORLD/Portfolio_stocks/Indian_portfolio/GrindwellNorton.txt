Silicon carbide (SiC) is a compound made up of silicon and carbon. It is a ceramic material that 
is extremely hard and durable, with excellent thermal conductivity, high melting point, and low thermal expansion. 
Silicon carbide has a wide range of industrial applications, including in the production of semiconductors, high-power electronics, 
and abrasive materials.

In electronics, SiC is used as a semiconductor material for high-power and high-temperature applications, such as in electric 
vehicles, renewable energy systems, and power supplies. Compared to traditional semiconductor materials like silicon, 
SiC can operate at higher voltages and temperatures while maintaining high efficiency.

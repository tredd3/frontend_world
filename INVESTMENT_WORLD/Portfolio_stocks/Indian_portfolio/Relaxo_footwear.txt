    there is huge competettion)

what peter lynch bucket does stock belongs to : fast growers


2)PRESENT :
---Sectoral analysis:
largely unorganised Sector
mostly companies outsource mnufacturing
no player in india  has low cost production of product on scale 
almost all the players except relaxo has products for high end customers
for low end customers unorganised players 
footwear per capita comsumption is 1.9 in india (world average is 3)
i.e per person we have only 2 pairs in india
---Products/services DEMAND check :
//From where does the demand come? 
//Type of demand
//Market size/Oppurtunity: huge

---Products/services SUPPLY check :
//product portfolio :
regular(non-premium OR mass market) - yes (it plays on volumes)

//Is there any peer whose market share is higher than the current company? 
POSITION IN PEERS :

//COMPETETION :
Avg selling price of metro brands : 1348, Bata : 540, Relaxo : 130
Metro - asset light model - because of 100% outsourcing of manufacturing -  COCO model - highest EBITDA per store
Bata - 50% insourcing +  50% outsourcing of manufacturing - COCO model + distribution
Relaxo - 100% insourcing - doesn't have own stores - it gives its products to distributors which inturn gives it to retailers

//how do peers provide competetion :

--- Products/services Uniqueness check :
what makes the product or service of this company Unique?

3)FUTURE :
---Process/Strategy check?
--- Sustainabile Growth of Earnings check (Moats and Growth oppurtunities)
1)Competettive advantage/MOAT Check?
Economises of Scale - Y
Low cost producer - Y
Brand
Entry barriers - Targets mass market and a market leader in that space 
2)PRICING POWER (MUST HAVE MOAT)
high - because the actual cost of manufactiring is distributed across all footwear
3)EARNING POWER 
//SOURCE OF EARNINGS
--Internal Growth oppurtunities

--External Growth oppurtunities
Macroeconomic
Tailwinds
//SOURCE OF CAPITAL : reserves
//RETURN ON CAPITAL



// SUMMARY (Business Quality Check) - decided by PAST, PRESENT and FUTURE of the company
  -Predictable and consistent/recurring EARNINGS for next 10 yrs(MOATS, pricing power)
  -Competes on value rather than price bcoz company that competes on value is like a magnet with stronger magnetic field  that
    attracts customers and companies which compete on price will lose their business to competetiors
  -prefer high margin non commoditized business - if commoditized then must be a low cost producer
  -Superior economics (what does company produce, target audience and how does it produce): ESG Principles
   Environmental: does the process/products cause any kind of pollution
   Social: does the products/services add some value to customers or do they waste their time or money or destroy their health
   Governance: Superior Management and board of directors
  -Scalable business model - globally preferred (mutibagger are made because of this property)
  -Company having calibre or potential to adapt to the changing business environment - having said that invest 
    in a business with slow rate of change, rapid change is the enemy of an investor as it needs more capital to adapt and 
    burns more cash to be in the competettion)
  -Having Tailwinds is an added advantage as it boosts the process of wealth creation and helps u in achieving goal faster

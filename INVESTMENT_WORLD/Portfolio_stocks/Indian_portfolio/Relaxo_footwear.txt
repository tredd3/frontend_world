  4)cyclicals(Auto industry, Travel)
  5)Asset heavy(most of the PSUs)

--------------------- PRESENT --------------------
---Sectoral analysis:
The Indian footwear industry is grouped into two segmentsâ€”leather and non-leather
In consumption terms, 86% of volume-wise global consumption of footwear is of non-leather.
The Indian non-leather footwear industry is highly fragmented, with 55% of production coming from the unorganized sector.
mostly companies outsource mnufacturing
no player in india  has low cost production of product on scale 
almost all the players except relaxo has products for high end customers
for low end customers unorganised players 
footwear per capita comsumption is 1.9 in india (world average is 3)
i.e per person we have only 2 pairs in india
The industry does not have a capital-intensive manufacturing process and hence, the barriers to entry of new players are low

//STAGE of development: growth 
//Sector value chain : from sourcing to sales entire process and businesses involved must be known (you should always pick companies 
at profitable end of value chain), demand and supply (size of opportunity)
//Market size/Oppurtunity or possible demand for the Sector: it is not about how big a company is, it is about how big a company can get
   only within the country :
        limited to few businesses/limited customer usage
        not limited to a single user (almost every user will find its usage now or eventually)
        not limited to single business (almost every business will find its usage now or eventually)
   global oppurtunity/exports :
        limited to few businesses/limited customer usage
        not limited to a single user (almost every user will find its usage now or eventually)
        not limited to single business (almost every business will find its usage now or eventually)

---Products/services DEMAND check :
//From where does the actual demand from for the company? 
  B2B (client diversification, strong order book - must be volume led growth)
  B2C (how many users out of 140 cr population use it)
  Business service companies (what all industries/companies need it)
  Government
  Global - from which all countries demand come from

//Type of demand
    Infrastructure/Platform - repeat usage including subscripton models
    continous and growing demand - volume led growth reaching to larger audience or more consumption(personal care, healthcare, 
       insurnace, real estate, home furnishing, Energy,Banking and finance)
    continous and replacement/upgradation demand based on latest trends/depreciation - value addition (clothing and footwear, 
        Electronics, Automobile, Telecommunication)
    continous and constant/slow growth demand(FMCG, Food)
    one time demand(capital goods) then growth oppurtunities size should be vast like Praj.Even though Praj establishes the ethanol
     plant, it has huge oppurtunity abroad/huge order backlog both domestic and abroad
    Transition Demand - EV, Renewable Energy, 5G, New Technology - need a lot of research as it can make or break your portfolio

//Capturing sector demand Oppurtunities:
sector demand is growing like Telecom, aviation : even if the company retains its market share and can sustain over the years 
  it can grow effortlessly
sector demand constant like FMCG :  company needs to capture market share from others by providing unique products or enetring in to 
   other FMCG verticals where the company is not even present


---Products/services SUPPLY check :
1)Product portfolio :
Relaxo 
Flite
Bahamas
Relaxo



2)COMPETETION : main competettior is unorganised players
Avg selling price of metro brands : 1348, Bata : 540, Relaxo : 130
Metro - asset light model - because of 100% outsourcing of manufacturing -  COCO model - highest EBITDA per store
Bata - 50% insourcing +  50% outsourcing of manufacturing - COCO model + distribution
Relaxo - 100% insourcing - doesn't have own stores - it gives its products to distributors which inturn gives it to retailers
global competettion - imports risk from china or any other low cost producer country?
threat of new entrants - Industry doesn't have any entry barriers


3)Listed peers Comparison: tijori(benchmark) and screener peer comparison sections for profitability and costs

4)Products/services Uniqueness and Quality check :
what makes the product or service of this company Unique?
  //does it delight the customers - when they don't find that product in a store will they go across the street to get it
  //does it own consumers mind(i.e people always remember this company when u talk about a specific product like drink,burger,choc etc)
  //what value does it add to customers compared to competetiors?
  //how is the quality of product/service - Have u used the product/service ? 
    if YES, what is your view 
    if NO, go and open their website, check public review in ecommerce or google search


------------------- FUTURE -----------------
---Goal/Aim that the company wants to achieve and what is the Strategy that it wants to employ?
//Goal/Aim - global leader, capture market share from unorganised players, cleanup stuff and become efficient etc
//Strategies being employed: 
ideally a company that clones other successful strategies is almost bound to win provided it has other necessary qualifications

--- EARNING POWER 
Earning Power is the ability of the company to grow or compound its earnings every year for a very longtime 

1)SOURCE OF EARNINGS (Earnings Growth Oppurtunities check )
earnings source is more than earnings itself bcoz earnings source decides whether the earning growth is sustainable or not, 
  i.e it decides quality of earnings

i)INTERNAL GROWTH OPPURTUNITIES
///Sales Growth led Earnings Growth(every firm needs this kind of growth)     
  1)Demand/Consumption led growth from NEW customers (Volume led growth)
    /penetration - Acquire new customers in untapped west and south India (already have a good presence in North India)
    /snatch market share - Acquire customers from unorganised players 
    /import substitution (Atam nirbhar bharat)
    /Global expansion/ exports - Launch products in new markets
    /Strong Order inflows (only for B2B companies)
    /Demand shift from other countries like (china+1 startegy, supplychain disruption in other countries,for low cost substitution
       products etc - but be careful here as they can move from India to someother country too) 
  2)Demand/Consumption led growth from OLD customers (Volume led growth)
    /increased consumption(volume led growth) - cutomers buy more of the current/old products
    /Launch New products - capex and manufacture new products(innovated products/renovated products/premium products)
    Note: mode of capex funding is also important: preference cash>debt>equity
  3)ONLY Price led Growth (Not preferred at all) - slow growers(very large and matured companies)
    /Increase the price of old product, but increase in volume -  if volumes don't increase after some years your company earnings
    growth rate = inflation(6%) and in the long run as the stock price depends ONLY on earnings, it will also grow at 6%, meaning ur 
    money also grows at 6% and the purpose of investing in stock markets to beat infalation is gone. Also if sales are not increasing 
    then demand has dried up OR competetiors taking away market share - Both are bad situations

///Efficiency led Earnings Growth(few firms have achieved it, they just need to maintain)
    /promoter OR management change
    /cost cutting(cannot cut cost beyond a certain point) - increasing operating efficiency and hence margins
    //spending on technology for achieving efficiency and modernising the workflow or processes
    /spin off - dispose losing operations (increases firm efficiency by increasing management focus)
    /process optimisation and innovation - chemicals and pharma mainly
    /Reduce debt - look at D/E trend over 10yrs and Debt/Profit should be less than 5
    NOTE: This form of growth will increase profitability of the firm in the short term, but a company cannot become efficient 
    after a certain point(even though it can maintain that efficiency) hence for the profitability to sustain in the longterm this
    needs to be augumented by Demand/consumption led growth either from New or Old customers(Preferably from new customers)
    But in the journey of company becoming efficient you can make huge profits and hence always check whether management is focusing
    on making the firm efficient or not apart from focusing on sales

ii)EXTERNAL: GROWTH OPPURTUNITIES
Macroeconomic:
 Indian footwear 10.8% CAGR in next 5yrs
 Rise of middle-income group and millennial population.
Tailwinds:
 Domestic manufacturing poised for growth in wake of decline in footwear imports.
 The growing trend of premiumization in the Indian footwear industry and the shift to branded footwear


Note: Internal growth is always preferred but sometimes the business size is so big that the size of internal growth oppurtunity 
   seems trivial and we need to opt for external growth. 
   for e.g: let us say if HUL identifies an internal growth oppurtunity that can increase its cash flow by 20% , however if HUL 
   opts and invests the capital in external growth oppurtunity instead, say acquisition then its cashflow grows by 50% then it
   is a no brainer to allocate capital for external growth opportunity by the Management



---- Sustainability of Earning power: MOATS and Pricing Power to make it a long term bet
1)Competettive advantage/MOAT Check?
Economises of Scale 
Network effect - It's distriution network comprises 50,000+ retailers, ~700 distributors & ~400 EBOs
Low cost producer -  Targets mass market and a market leader in that space with low cost products
Brand

2)PRICING POWER (MUST HAVE MOAT)
Not able to pass on the raw material price completely due to inflation (bcoz consumers may choose unorganised sector low 
  priced products)


3) Longterm vs short term bet
/Preferred Investment: Both MOATS and Earnings Growth oppurtunities need to exist for sustainable Earnings
/Company with No Moats  but very high growth oppurtunities - a short term buy becuase other competetiors with MOATS can take away the
market share soon - need to monitor closely
/Company with good MOATS but not very good growth oppurtunities - it has become a slow grower(if they genrate a stable free cashflow
you can use the cash to buy other growth and non-growth businesses) 
Note: Don't forget to compare dividend yield with FD interest rates


----Capital Allocation 
//SOURCE OF CAPITAL - Retained Earnings


//USE OF NEW/INCREMENTAL CAPITAL : A good company always uses capital for progressing and next phase growth and not for survival 
Dividends
Capex - recurring (100cr per yr on an average)
R&D
Advertising


Good company: ROCE/ROIC(return on capital) >> WACC (cost of capital)
i.e Capital is increasing and ROCE is constant

// SUMMARY (Business Quality Check) - decided by PAST, PRESENT and FUTURE of the company
  -Predictable and consistent/recurring EARNINGS for next 10 yrs(MOATS, pricing power)
  -Competes on value rather than price bcoz company that competes on value is like a magnet with stronger magnetic field  that
    attracts customers and companies which compete on price will lose their business to competetiors
  -prefer high margin non commoditized business - if commoditized then must be a low cost producer
  -lousy industry/highly competettive industry/niche industry(no big players have entered yet) ?
  -proxy play on some capital intensive/debt heavy/lousy industry ? 
  -give high allocation to recession proof stocks(like QSR) , if not how did the company perform during recession years
  -Superior economics (what does company produce, target audience and how does it produce): ESG Principles
   Environmental: does the process/products cause any kind of pollution
   Social: does the products/services add some value to customers or do they waste their time or money or destroy their health
   Governance: Superior Management and board of directors
  -Scalable business model - globally preferred (mutibagger are made because of this property)
  -Company having calibre or potential to adapt to the changing business environment - having said that invest 
    in a business with slow rate of change, rapid change is the enemy of an investor as it needs more capital to adapt and 
    burns more cash to be in the competettion)
  -Having Tailwinds is an added advantage as it boosts the process of wealth creation and helps u in achieving goal faster
  -If a person has lot of money can he break ur business and take away marketshare?
  -Ideal business always takes little amount of capital to operate and an excellent business always
    earns same high returns on incremental capital

//how is the Management and their Vision:
Skill: MD is a Commerce Graduate & Rubber Technologist 
Whole Time Director has studied from International School of Modern Shoemaking
focus on gaining market share gain rather than bulk price increase during recession or tough times

----------------------------------- RISKS ----------------------------------------
check Risk_Check.txt
---Business Risk:
fluctuation in raw material prices and exchange rates as most of the raw materials are imported
Stiff competition in industry from unorganised sector 
no control on sales - target customer is very price sensitive (their low purchasing power impacts the business of the company)
strong presence of the unorganised sector will continue for sometime until consumers move to organised

---Financial Risk:
Significant outflows towards capex likely to continue hence FCF will be pressurised

---Management Risk:

---Investment Returns Risk:

Investor presentation for reference: 
1)PAST :

2)PRESENT :
---Sectoral analysis:
alcohol per capita consumption : 5.9 litres per litres per year
EUROPE: 12 L
US: 9L
China: 7.5L

Whisky consumption is 75% of the total consumption
consolidation of industry - 15 players remaining
difficult to build economies of scale as prices varies bcoz of tax rate change according to states
7 states - pricing power
2 states - banned
12 states - state govt controls the pricing
5 states - need to negotiate 
//STAGE of development:
pioneering - EV, green energy
growth - internet
maturity/saturation - FMCG
declining - obselete - TV channels, print media
//Sector value chain : from sourcing to sales entire process and businesses involved must be known (you should always pick companies 
at profitable end of value chain), demand and supply (size of opportunity)

---Products/services DEMAND check :
//From where does the demand come? 
//Type of demand
//Market size/Oppurtunity: huge

---Products/services SUPPLY check :
//product portfolio :
regular - 
prestige and above - premium
The Company launched ten new brands over the past decade. Of these new brands, nine brands are in the premium category.

//Is there any peer whose market share is higher than the current company? 
POSITION IN PEERS :

//COMPETETION :

//how do peers provide competetion :

--- Products/services Uniqueness check :
what makes the product or service of this company Unique?


3)FUTURE :
---Process/Strategy check?
--- Sustainabile Growth of Earnings check (Moats and Growth oppurtunities)
1)Competettive advantage/MOAT Check?
Economises of Scale - N
Low cost producer - N
Brand
Taste
Entry barriers - difficult to get license from state govt, no alcohol drink advertising allowed, 
Luxury/Premium Range
2)PRICING POWER (MUST HAVE MOAT)
very high - people don't mind spendinging as alcohol is either consumed in group or in parties
3)EARNING POWER 
//SOURCE OF EARNINGS
--Internal Growth oppurtunities
CSD canteen demand - no foreign liquor allowed, hence this a strongest MOAT
export growth oppurtunities
focus on high margin/premium products
--External Growth oppurtunities
Macroeconomic
Tailwinds
//SOURCE OF CAPITAL : reserves
//RETURN ON CAPITAL


// SUMMARY (Business Quality Check) - decided by PAST, PRESENT and FUTURE of the company
  -Predictable and consistent/recurring EARNINGS for next 10 yrs(MOATS, pricing power)
  -Competes on value rather than price bcoz company that competes on value is like a magnet with stronger magnetic field  that
    attracts customers and companies which compete on price will lose their business to competetiors
  -prefer high margin non commoditized business - if commoditized then must be a low cost producer
  -lousy industry/highly competettive industry/niche industry(no big players have entered yet) ?
  -proxy play on some capital intensive/debt heavy/lousy industry ? 
  -Superior economics (what does company produce, target audience and how does it produce): ESG Principles
   Environmental: does the process/products cause any kind of pollution
   Social: does the products/services add some value to customers or do they waste their time or money or destroy their health
   Governance: Superior Management and board of directors
  -Scalable business model - globally preferred (mutibagger are made because of this property)
  -Company having calibre or potential to adapt to the changing business environment - having said that invest 
    in a business with slow rate of change, rapid change is the enemy of an investor as it needs more capital to adapt and 
    burns more cash to be in the competettion)
  -Having Tailwinds is an added advantage as it boosts the process of wealth creation and helps u in achieving goal faster


------------------------------ FINANCIAL STRENGTH CHECK --------------------------
check Financial_Strength_Check.txt
//Financial strengths
No margin impact - due to Premiumisation and in-house ENA production
expenses - 7% of sales in brand building
//Financial weakness

------------------------------ MANAGEMENT CHECK --------------------------------

----------------------------------- RISKS ----------------------------------------
check Risk_Check.txt
---Business Risk:
1)Lower than anticipated sugarcane production and/or any sharp rise in prices of molasses or grains or of ENA could have an impact
 on the company’s profitability. 
 However, the company maintains a sizable inventory of molasses which insulates it against short and medium term fluctuations in molasses prices.
2)ENA prices may also increase due its alternative uses, especially in ethanol blending and a more attractive price offered by the petrochemical industry. 
 However, the company’s capability to shift to a grain-based distillery insulates it against any significant increase in prices of 
 molasses.
 Further, RKL has flexibility to shift its production between grains and molasses with change in prices of each.
2)Liquor ban might be a risk - highly regulated industry


---Financial Risk:
high tax rates

---Management Risk:

---Investment Returns Risk:

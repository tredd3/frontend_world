  Valuation is what differentiates Great Investment from a great business
  will it beat Index in the next 10yrs if you buy at current valuations(https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nKjmPeIAiBJj7I_hbipXbBysa4ZhoK9qVxh6spmKejo/edit#gid=0)

------------------- SCREENING SUMMARY -------------------
//General check:
  stock picking strategy: bottoms-up/top-down/cloning/contratian/familiar with the product or industry/profits going down due to 
     capacity to suffer/suggestion from youtuber or broker
  Normal check on stock price since inception - google search (any abnormal increase or decrease in share price?)
  Abnormal falling: google search why a company share is falling - check Why_Stock_Price_Falling.txt
  Abnormal increase: EPS, PE, manipulation(FII/DII buying at random prices taking share 
    prices up and lock  retail folks at higher prices OR buying via shell companies inflating 
    the share price naturally like Adani once did)
  legal orders(confirm from wiki) and tickertape
  corporate actions, dividend history and announcements from tickertape
  check shareholding pattern(especially promoter) trend over the years in tijori
    Promoter holding : higher is the better
    Institutional ownership: lower is the better because if the company performs well they keep buying it and share price takes off
  promoter pledging
  Is the business easy to understand or complex : easy/complex
  circle of competence: Yes/No
  any recent insider buying (bse india > disclosures > insider trading) OR Value Research(ownership section) for US stocks
  (Especially if normal employees are buying apart form promoters/top management then its a positive sign as they know better
     than any broker/analyst/investor)
  any bulk or block deals (to discover price?

//Business check:
  screener pros and cons
  market share trend
  //how is the quality of product/service - Have u used the product/service ? 
    if YES, what is your view 
    if NO, go and open their website, check public review in ecommerce or google search
  CRISIL Rating must be Above A and check Rating History for last 3 Years - upgraded from BBB to A-
  open RHP for complete information and risks (if a company is recently listed then this must)
  can a fool run this business
  can you put 50% of your net worth, buy the whole business and forget about it for next 5-10 yrs ???
   assuming that stock market is closed for next 5-10yrs are you ok holding the entire business without knowing its price every year?
  for longterm : don't invest in a stock just bcoz the stock price will increase, invest because you want to own that business

//Finance check:
1)Balance sheet Strength check
--Equity/Total assets (liabilities should be as less as possible for a strong balance sheet)
--(Price to book value) - 5 (not an asset play)

//non-current assets - <value>
-if Goodwill is more on the assets side but the acquired companies are not able to generate profits then Book value significantly 
  decreases because people won't buy the company or value the company for the price at which u have bought
-intangible assets that help u in creating some value or they themselves have some value that others are willing to pay is fine else
  they also can loose value like crazy
-long term investments (won't lose value but depends on the investment if it is a business and doing bad it might lose value) -
  u need to check notes to consolidated financial statements

//Net current assets -<value>
-cash , land and  financial investments won't lose value - indicating that the balance sheet is strong
-inventory as % of total assets - can quickly lose value depending on the type of inventory like fashion will quickly lose it,
  but raw materials will not 
--check current assets(mainly cash) compared to current liabilities - bcoz if current liabilities > current assets then u need to 
  sell non current-assets to clear them or take loan (both are bad)

//shareholder Equity -<value>
--Check Equity CAGR from balance sheet equity section 
   if it is constant then check dividend section in cashflow analysis bcoz company might be giving out its earnings as dividend OR 
     (check share capital section where company might be doing buyback)
   if it is decreasing then it MUST be only from buybacks (if not company is doing something wrong it is losing/selling its assets)
   if equity is increasing check ROE trend
--Sorce of Equity increase: to find this out balance sheet should be studied in tally with cash flow statement
 Sustainable:  cash flow from operations(goes in to retained earnings) 
 Non-sustainable(one-off): cash from from investments(goes in to retained earnings) and financing activities(goes into share 
  capital, u need to check EPS trend)

//non-current Liabilities - <value>

2)Profit and loss statement
--sales growth consistent and increasing?
--operating profit +ve  most of the time and growing?
--earnings quality check : core business vs other income contribution to profits over the years?
--interest expense >40-50% of operating profit?
--net income consistently +ve and growing? 
  
3)Cashflow statement
--operating cash flow must be atleast 70-80% of  operating profit 
--CFO +ve most of the time and growing?
--free cash flow consistently +ve and growing?
Note: if free cash flow is -ve check why
free cash flow -ve bcoz of operating cash flow(-ve net income) => company is bad and in-efficienct
free cash flow -ve bcoz of operating cash flow(-ve WCC , i.e either bcoz of inventory increase or recievables increase)
free cash flow -ve bcoz of capex => is it doing continous survival capex(10 yr check cash flow analysis)
--use of cash flow from operations: check 10yr cash flow analysis in tijori (preferrence is reinvestment)
//check cashflow from financing section
-- if debt is increasing u need to check the usage of debt in investment section or is to cover Operating loses?
-- if equity is increasing?  (if yes EPS should also increase)

4)Profitability Ratios Check:
--GPM(consistent and above 15%) trend - company has Pricing power 
--OPM(consistent and above 15%) trend - company has Efficient management 
--NPM(consistent and above 15%) trend - good profitability
Note: if NPM is less then check Asset turnover ratio, if both are less than ROE is less and you need to avoid that business
--ROE consistent and  10-15% (with D/E under control)? ROE is the real return as this indicates that owners wealth is being compounded 
--ROCE(consistent and above 15%) trend - return on capital is good than cost of capital
--ROIC(consistent and above 15%) trend- company is generating enough cash in its core business
--check D/E , Note: it's not about how much debt the company has taken, it's about the repaying capacity
if Debt > 0:
check in the balance sheet if the debt is a short term one or longterm one (it must be longterm)
if short term debt, then current assets > current liabilities?
if long term debt is it increasing over the years?
  Total debt: 
  Cash:
  operating cashflow: (can long term debt can be cleared by operating profits/operating cashflow of 5 yrs)

//Valuation check - Tijori finance valuation
Price is different Valuation is different, just bcoz stock is falling doesn't mean it is cheap(earnings might be falling too)
Price - is what people pay for the business
Valuation is price compared to earnings 
Note: Don't invest in a stock because the price has fallen and you think the price will increase , own the stock because you 
 understand that business(circle of competence) , believe in its future(i.e predictability and earning power) and it 
 is available at lower valuations (absolute(DCF) and relative, with more focus on absolute)
--EV/FCF(Market cap + debt - cash&cash equivalents)/Free cash flow Valuation

--------------------------- BUSINESS STRENGTH CHECK ---------------------------
Investor presentation for reference: 
-------------------- PAST --------------------
know about the company:
  Nature of business: consumer goods & B2B goods
  What does it do: (what is the actual business): Largest manufaturer of PVC, CPVC piping system
    used in plumbing, drainage, agriculture, industrial & electrical 
  How does it do :
    Astral got the license for CPVC resin from Lubrizol(Patent holder)
    Thompson Plastics, USA which provided Astral with the technical know-how for setting up the CPVC plant.
    pioneer in many products
    Astral collabarated with Plumbers Just like Asian paints did directing market with painters & Pidilite with Carpenters 
    present in pipes, fittings, adhesives - helping to gain market share from unorganised players
    GPM significantly improved to 35% due to backward integration of raw materials
    moved away from 3 tier distribution model to 2 tier model
    wants to become a complete water solutions provider - hence acquistions in relevant areas (raw materials, Adhesives etc)
    management focus on new & high margin products in next 3-5 yrs
    No new capacity will be added as the capacity utilisation is 65% and the The FCF generated from current businesses 
      will be used to fund Water Tanks & Adhesives segments
  Subsidaries/JVs:
  Target Audience : 
  market size: huge/large/small - if a company's market size is small even though it's a market leader it doesn't matter as it 
    cannot be a multi bagger 
  market share: 
    3.18% Adhesives , 7.52% PVC Pipes, 0.08% Water Tanks
    prince pipes - 5%
    Supreme 11%
    Unorganised - 51%
  Presence : offices in India /US etc
  Globally competetive company: NO
  REVENUE by GEOGRAPHY: India 90%, others 10%
  Revenue by Product: pipes 77%, adhesives 23%
  Revenue by Customers: B2B(), B2C() , Govt
  Clients(Important ones):
promoters:
why did the promoters start the business: to capture the huge oppurtunity in some industry
  Promoter Sandeep Engineer sold his house to fund the Equity
  He himself went shop to shop to sell the products
any research report/youtube analysis available for the company: 
what peter lynch bucket does stock belongs to : slow growers/stalwarts/fast growers/cyclicals/asset heavy/turover(special situation)
Note: Categories of Stock: stalwarts

--------------------- PRESENT --------------------
---Sectoral analysis: 
total market size: 30,000cr
shift from metal pipes to Plastic pipes 
Sector is expected to grow at 10-12% CAGR
per capita plastic consumption in india (10), world Avg (30)

Sector growth oppurtunities : 
75% household have no access to drinking water
84% rural households have no piped water
50% arable land is not irrigated
60cr (out of 140cr face) water stress
lot of govt initiatives

Demand from : oil&gas transportation, real estate, irrigation, industrial production, replacement of aging pipes, smart cities
HDPE - sewage, processing & chemical industry, city gas distribution
PVC - drainage, irrigation, borewell (more sound, not chemical resistant)
UPVC - drainage, irrigation, cold water plumbing (chemical resistant)
CPVC - Industrial applications, hot & cold water plumbing (less sound, corossion free, lead free, fire-resistant & high temp resistant)
 CPVC is a superior product as compared to PVC due to its ductile strength
composite pipes - corrosion free & strong mechanical properties

35% unorganised, 65% organised : pipe is a commodity product but fittings is what gives specalisation and allows organiesd 
players to gain market share from unorganised players

//STAGE of development: growth

//Sector value chain : RM(EDC, Ethylene) -> PVC plant -> PVC Resign -> Dealers -> Consumers

//Market size/Oppurtunity or possible demand for the Sector: it is not about how big a company is, it is about how big a company can get
   only within the country :
        limited to few businesses/limited customer usage
        not limited to a single user (almost every user will find its usage now or eventually)
        not limited to single business (almost every business will find its usage now or eventually)
   global oppurtunity/exports :
        limited to few businesses/limited customer usage
        not limited to a single user (almost every user will find its usage now or eventually)
        not limited to single business (almost every business will find its usage now or eventually)

---Products/services DEMAND check :
//From where does the actual demand from for the company? 
  B2B (client diversification, strong order book - must be volume led growth)
  B2C (how many users out of 140 cr population use it)
  Global - from which all countries demand come from

//Type of demand
    continous and growing demand - sector growth due to proxy play on many industries
    continous and replacement/upgradation - little
    one time demand - B2C segment
    Transition Demand - from UPVC , Metal , Cement pipes to CPVC, 


---Products/services SUPPLY check :
1)Product portfolio - what all products company manufactures (you can find in investor presentation) - check revenue contribution 
  of each product
Note: if you are investing in this company only because of a specific product like chawyan prash(dabur), Royal enfield(Eicher) etc
always check wt % revenues are contributed by that product (for Eicher RE contributes around 90% revenues so it can be a buy based
 on further analysis but Dabur cannot be a buy based on chawayan prash because it contibutes < 10% to revenue)
e.g: tatva chintan has a huge portfolio and electrolytic salts to be used in EV is roughly 5% of their portfolio - so don't invest
  only based on EV exposure


2)COMPETETION :  Never look for companies that doesn't have competetion, always prefer companies that sustained competettion with their 
             MOATS bcoz someday or the other competettion is bound to come if it is a high margin business. At the same time Never 
             invest in a business that is present in a highly competettive industry that competes ONLY on price instead of value
  what is the unlisted players market share - 
  listed peers market share -
  postion among peers - 
  global competettion - imports risk from china or any other low cost producer country?
  threat of new entrants
Note: 
 if a business is extremely profitable then it attracts lot of capital , hence taking away gains/market share (so MOAT check is imp)
 if a business is dull/not profitable then lot of competettion goes away => current company that survives or control expenses will 
   keep gaining market share and eventually turns profitable (keep an eye)

3)Listed peers Comparison: tijori(benchmark) and screener peer comparison sections for profitability and costs
how do peers provide competetion : strong moats/geographical expansion/innovative products/capex spending
Pro Tip: if all Peers are equally profitable and equally effecient then low WC/sales(less capital needed to generate sales) and
  low CCC(less time taken to generate profits) is preferred

4)Products/services Uniqueness and Quality check :
what makes the product or service of this company Unique?
  //does it delight the customers - when they don't find that product in a store will they go across the street to get it
  //does it own consumers mind(i.e people always remember this company when u talk about a specific product like drink,burger,choc etc)
  //what value does it add to customers compared to competetiors?
  //how is the quality of product/service - Have u used the product/service ? 
    if YES, what is your view 
    if NO, go and open their website, check public review in ecommerce or google search


------------------- FUTURE -----------------
---Goal/Aim that the company wants to achieve and what is the Strategy that it wants to employ?
//Goal/Aim - global leader, capture market share from unorganised players, cleanup stuff and become efficient etc
//Strategies being employed: 
ideally a company that clones other successful strategies is almost bound to win provided it has other necessary qualifications


--- EARNING POWER 
Earning Power is the ability of the company to grow or compound its earnings every year for a very longtime 

1)SOURCE OF EARNINGS (Earnings Growth Oppurtunities check )
earnings source is more than earnings itself bcoz earnings source decides whether the earning growth is sustainable or not, 
  i.e it decides quality of earnings

i)INTERNAL GROWTH OPPURTUNITIES
///Sales Growth led Earnings Growth(every firm needs this kind of growth)     
  1)Demand/Consumption led growth from NEW customers (Volume led growth)
    /penetration - Acquire new customers in untapped and rural areas
    /snatch market share - both from organised and unorganised players
    /Global expansion/ exports - Launch products in new markets
    /20% Volume growth in Adhesives segment, 15% vol growth in pipes segment
    /Demand shift from other countries like (china+1 startegy, supplychain disruption in other countries,for low cost substitution
       products etc - but be careful here as they can move from India to someother country too) 
  2)Demand/Consumption led growth from OLD customers (Volume led growth)
    /increased consumption(volume led growth) - cutomers buy more of the current/old products
    /Launch New products - water tank segment
  3)ONLY Price led Growth (Not preferred at all) - slow growers(very large and matured companies)
    Check Volume growth in investor presentation/Annual report to find this out
    /Increase the price of old product, but increase in volume -  if volumes don't increase after some years your company earnings
    growth rate = inflation(6%) and in the long run as the stock price depends ONLY on earnings, it will also grow at 6%, meaning ur 
    money also grows at 6% and the purpose of investing in stock markets to beat infalation is gone. Also if sales are not increasing 
    then demand has dried up OR competetiors taking away market share - Both are bad situations

///Efficiency led Earnings Growth(few firms have achieved it, they just need to maintain)
    /promoter OR management change
    /cost cutting(cannot cut cost beyond a certain point) - increasing operating efficiency and hence margins
    //spending on technology for achieving efficiency and modernising the workflow or processes
    /spin off - dispose losing operations (increases firm efficiency by increasing management focus)
    /process optimisation and innovation - chemicals and pharma mainly
    /Reduce debt - look at D/E trend over 10yrs and Debt/Profit should be less than 5
    NOTE: This form of growth will increase profitability of the firm in the short term, but a company cannot become efficient 
    after a certain point(even though it can maintain that efficiency) hence for the profitability to sustain in the longterm this
    needs to be augumented by Demand/consumption led growth either from New or Old customers(Preferably from new customers)
    But in the journey of company becoming efficient you can make huge profits and hence always check whether management is focusing
    on making the firm efficient or not apart from focusing on sales

ii)EXTERNAL: GROWTH OPPURTUNITIES
  /cloning other great company strategies
  /Acquistion and synergy led growth(Acquistion for strategic purpose(augumenting existing business like acquiring firm that supplies
    key raw materials, firm that has excellent technology and skilled manpower, firm that has reputation globally and is present in 
    areas where the current firm doesn't OR in simple words acquire any firm that adds value by doing something which the current 
    firm doesn't OR any firm that increases the efficieny of the current firm operations) 
  /vertical integration - zero dependence on others, high avialbility, cost advantage and quality control e.g: Apple, Amazon
  /backward or forward integration
  /Macroeconomic oppurtunity
  -it is in a growing sector with tailwinds - every company in the sector will grow like Indian IT companies, chemicals etc
   even if the company retains its market share and can sustain over the years it can grow effortlessly
  -support from govt - relief packages etc - (not preferred if relief is for short term)
  /Tailwinds - china+1, russia Ukrain War etc

Note: Internal growth is always preferred but sometimes the business size is so big that the size of internal growth oppurtunity 
   seems trivial and we need to opt for external growth. 
   for e.g: let us say if HUL identifies an internal growth oppurtunity that can increase its cash flow by 20% , however if HUL 
   opts and invests the capital in external growth oppurtunity instead, say acquisition then its cashflow grows by 50% then it
   is a no brainer to allocate capital for external growth opportunity by the Management


2)Sustainability of Earnings: MOATS and Pricing Power to make it a long term bet
i)Competettive advantage/MOAT Check? check MOATS_check.txt
MOAT - is the trait or quality that a business has bcoz of which competettion cannot snatch away its earnings and customers
Note: do not invest in businesses whose moats are primarily driven by regulations and political linkages.
Economises of Scale - supply side
Low cost producer - check product quality and profitability ratios
Brand - by sepnding more on advertisement
Network effect - strong dealer & distributor network
 PAN INDIA PRESENCE LEADS TO 2% TO 3% SAVINGS ON LOGISTICS
Intangible assets
Switching costs


Note: Does MOAT Exists? 
  if yes is the MOAT durable, i.e can the company keep its DCA nature for next 10 yrs OR will competetiors snatch away 
   the profits? Imagine and think with a calm mind where do you see this company in the next 10 yrs,
   take in to account, facts and reasoning not opinion
  if NO MOAT what is the 10 yr picture u have in ur mind? will it build one?

ii)PRICING POWER (MUST HAVE MOAT)- can the company be able to sustain in recession, inflation, supply chain disruption situations
   or another company specific costs where the prices of everything would have gone up. During these unforseen situations company
   might not make profits but atleast it shouldn't do business in losses
Pricing power implies people are willing to pay premium (can the company increase the product/services prices in the cases
 like inflation and supply chain disruption or in general and be sure that people still buy their products and they don't loose their 
 business to competettion) 
 Proof: if costs increase then sales must increase and GPM trend is either stable or upwards(tijori) 
 This will happen only when :
   i)The product or service is unique and there is hardly any substitute
   ii)NO bargaining power of suppliers: suppliers shouldn't have more bargaining power, if they have then better to own the supplier stocks
     Bargining power of suppliers(low or -ve accounts payable) - critical parts/services suppliers, ONLY producer/supplier of certain products
     Bargining power of company(-ve working capital) - bulk and recurring buy, company with MOATS (as the demand is sustainable)
    Note: Account payables is high meaning company having bargaining power
   iii)NO bargaining power of buyers :
     Bargaining power of buyers(higher inventory days as people always look for bargain in other places, high account recievables as
     the company needs to give the product on credit ) - if client base is limited then company doesn't have a choice but to sell 
     the products at a lower price, if the buyer demands so, especially true for B2B suppliers 
     OR if a company in a highly competettive business (e-commerce, airlines) where people never want to pay premium OR if the 
     product is a commodity (then people always look for low price as value is same across producers)

Note: Pricing power is must for capex heavy companies(high fixed cost or operating leverage) companies with large amounts of
 debt - otherwise they can go Bankruptcy and destroy shareholder's wealth during recession.

Thesis :
/Longterm Investment: Both MOATS and Earnings Growth oppurtunities exists
/Shorterm Investment: Company with No Moats  but very high growth oppurtunities - a short term buy becuase other competetiors 
 with MOATS can take away the market share soon - need to monitor closely
/Company with good MOATS but not very good growth oppurtunities - it has become a slow grower(if they genrate a stable free cashflow
you can use the cash to buy other growth and non-growth businesses) 
Note: Don't forget to compare dividend yield with FD interest rates


----Capital Allocation 
//SOURCE OF CAPITAL - Debt/Retained Earnings/New Equity
EPS = Net Income(earnings)/Total Shares outstanding
1)RETAINED EARNINGS(cheapest and most preferred) - i.e reinvest free cashflow generated by the company
+ve scenario: Earnings increase => EPS increases => share price increases
-ve scenario: you will lose Reserves, but your Earnings will remain same => EPS remains same => share price remains constant
most importantly it doesn't have to pay any interest , also the total number of shares outstanding doesn't change
Hence a company needs to do some experimentation with the products/geography or try something new it is preferred to use 
RETAINED EARNINGS by generating more operating cash
2)DEBT(next preference)
+ve scenario: Earnings increase => debt repaid => after repayment whatever company acquired using debt(brand value, building, plant 
  and machinery) will remian with the company and fetch cash forever
-ve scenario: if debt levels are very high and Earnings decrease => company need to sell assets and repay debt => Bankruptcy
3)NEW EQUITY(EPS will decrease) - ESOPs, Preferential issue, QIP, Private placement etc
+ve scenario: new equity raised is used in the best way possible (reinvesting in own buiness/M&A) => Earnings increase => EPS increase
  and hence share price increases
-ve scenario: Earnings decrease and Total Shares outstanding increases, EPS drastcically goes down and hence stock will be overvalued
  taking share prices down bcoz of massive selling


---USE OF NEW/INCREMENTAL CAPITAL : A good company always uses capital for achieving operating efficiency or focus on next phase
 growth and not for survival (like expenses , capex maintenance etc) - if it uses for survival then it is capital intensive business
Inorganic growth - M&A for strategic purpose or to build a MOAT
Dividends - most mature companies give out dividends as they don't find better oppurtunities to re-invest profits
Capex - new
Advertising - brand building and awareness activity but the amount spent has to be monitored, along with sales growth

//RETURN ON CAPITAL
https://goodcalculators.com/wacc-calculator/
why Return on Capital is important?
Over the longterm the investment returns will always resemble the capital returns

Avg company : ROIC/ROCE ~= WACC and Capital is increasing and ROCE is decreasing (assuming there is no ongoing capex or money locked
  in other activities)
Good company: ROCE/ROIC(return on capital) > WACC (cost of cpital) and 
either ROCE is increasing and capital is constant OR Capital is increasing and ROCE is constant
Ideal company : if it can redeploy the incremental capital for same/high returns over time - it becomes a compounding machine
i.e both ROCE and capital is increasing

// SUMMARY (Business Quality Check) - decided by PAST, PRESENT and FUTURE of the company
  -Ideal business: Yes/No
   always takes little amount of capital to operate and an excellent business always earns same high returns on incremental capital

   POSITIVES:
  -Superior economics (what does company produce, target audience and how does it produce): ESG Principles
   Environmental: does the process/products cause any kind of pollution
   Social: does the products/services add some value to customers or do they waste their time or money or destroy their health
   Governance: Superior Management and board of directors
  -Predictable and consistent EARNINGS for next 10 yrs(sticky and recurring)
  -Repeat business - people need to keep buying it to survive/daily needs 
  -Platform/Infrastucture Business(Indiamart, IEX, Amazon, Delhivery) - (MOAT: Economies of scale, Switching cost, Distribution network)
  -Competes on value rather than price bcoz company that competes on value is like a magnet with stronger magnetic field  that
    attracts customers and companies which compete on price will lose their business to competetiors
  -recession proof ? how did it perform in 2008 and 2020 crisis
    Note : high debt or high capex companies can go bust during recession or high inflatory situations(if no pricing power)
  -Scalable business model - globally preferred (mutibagger are made because of this property)
  -proxy play on some industry ? 
  -Lousy industriy Survivor: operating in boring/lousy industries where no one wants to enter or companies in that sector
   facing heavy loses and low profitability or no growth, hence the Survivor
  -niche/extreme niche - does something very specific which takes a lot of time to build (MOAT: entry barriers, switching cost)
  -deals with very sensitive sectors needing lot of approvals and gain client trust/confidence
  -Having Tailwinds is an added advantage as it boosts the process of wealth creation and helps u in achieving goal faster

  NEGATIVES:
  -dependent on govt OR Linked to Govt: Price controlled by Govt, Govt is the only Customer , Anti-dumping duty by Govt
  -non Predictable for next 5-10yrs
  -competes only on Price with very little value addition and attract via discounts like Food delivery, Paytm , Nykaa
  -not recession proof
  -commoditized business - if commoditized the it must be a low cost producer
  -cyclical - cyclical revenues and cashflows
  -highly competettive industry like Auto/Telecom/Aviation etc
  -Non scalable business Either bcoz of limited market size OR Global competettion
  -limited clients - Zero pricing power
  -CONTINOUSLY needs to add and upgrade capex to stay in business like infra comapnies (telecom, energy, airlines, utilities)
  -CONTINOUSLY needs to spend more money on R&D to stay in business like electronics, auto and pharma companies that spend heavily on R&D
  -If a person has lot of money he can break ur business and take away marketshare
  -diworsefication - enetering in to businesses or acquiring businesses that doesn't belong to the expertise level of the current 
  company 
  -Avoid serial Acquirers
  -B2B player that doesn't have pricing power because of high competettion, commoditised or no MOATs
  -lower end of value chain

----------------------------------- RISKS ----------------------------------------
check Risk_Check.txt
what happens if any of the risks play out? will it impact the business in a big way

---Business Risk:
CPVC entry barriers are reducing
competetive intensity is increasing - hence they are focusing on complete solutions and adhesives segment (keeping pipes business 
 as cash generating machine)
cyclical as raw materials are derived from crude oil 
Inventory loss can happen (since CPVC is a commodity)

---Financial Risk:

------------------- SCREENING SUMMARY -------------------
//General check:
  stock picking strategy: bottoms-up/top-down/cloning/contratian/familiar with the product or industry/profits going down due to 
     capacity to suffer/suggestion from youtuber or broker
  Normal check on stock price since inception - google search (any abnormal increase or decrease in share price?)
  Abnormal falling: google search why a company share is falling - check Why_Stock_Price_Falling.txt
  Abnormal increase: EPS, PE, manipulation(FII/DII buying at random prices taking share 
    prices up and lock  retail folks at higher prices OR buying via shell companies inflating 
    the share price naturally like Adani once did)
  legal orders(confirm from wiki) and tickertape
  corporate actions, dividend history and announcements from tickertape
  check shareholding pattern(especially promoter) trend over the years in tijori
    Institutional ownership: lower is the better because if the company performs well they keep buying it and share price takes off
  promoter pledging
  Is the business easy to understand or complex : easy/complex
  circle of competence: YEs/No
  any recent insider buying (bse india > disclosures > insider trading) (Especially if normal employees are buying apart form 
    promoters/top management then its a positive sign as they know better than any broker/analyst/investor)


//Business check:
  screener pros and cons
  market share trend
  //how is the quality of product/service - Have u used the product/service ? 
    if YES, what is your view 
    if NO, go and open their website, check public review in ecommerce or google search
  CRISIL Rating must be Above A and check Rating History for last 3 Years(scroll down in crisil report)
  can a fool run this business
  can you put 25% of your net worth, buy the whole business and forget about it for next 5-10 yrs ???
   assuming that stock market is closed for next 5-10yrs are you ok holding the entire business without knowing its price every year?
  for longterm : don't invest in a stock just bcoz the stock price will increase, invest because you want to own that business

//Finance check:
  //Balance sheet
--Total assets(current valuation) compared with Marketcap - to identify asset plays
--check current assets(mainly cash) compared to current liabilities - bcoz if current liabilities > current assets then u need to 
  sell non current-assets to clear them or take loan (both are bad)
--shareholder Equity growth should be due to retained earnings growth and not new common stock(check cashlow statement - financing 
  activity -- proceeds from shares section)
  //Profit and loss statement
--sales growth consistent and increasing?
--operating profit +ve  most of the time and growing?
--other income significant to operating profit over the years?
--interest expense >40-50% of operating profit?
--net income consistently +ve and growing? 
//Cashflow statement
--CFO +ve most of the time and growing?
--free cash flow consistently +ve and growing?
Note: if free cash flow is -ve check why
free cash flow -ve bcoz of operating cash flow => company is bad and in-efficienct
free cash flow -ve bcoz of capex => is it doing continous capex(10 yr check cash flow analysis)
--use of freecash flow: dividends
--outstanding shares increasing every year ? check cashflow from financing section (if yes, EPS should also increase)
//Profitability Ratios Check:
--NPM(consistent and above 10%) - company has Pricing power 
--OPM(consistent and above 10%) - company has Efficient management 
--ROE consistent and  10-15% (with D/E under control)? ROE is the real return as this indicates that owners wealth is being compounded 
--ROCE(consistent and above 15%) - good profitability
--ROIC(consistent and above 15%) - company is generating enough cash in its core business
--D/E < 1?
if D/E > 0 check in the balance sheet if the long term debt is increasing ?
check D/E trend
can long term debt can be cleared by earnings of 4 yrs?(look at debt/Profit metrics in screener)

//Valuation check
Price is different Valuation is different, just bcoz stock is falling doesn't mean it is cheap(earnings might be falling too)
Price - is what people pay for the business
Valuation is price compared to earnings 
Note: Don't invest in a stock because the price has fallen and you think the price will increase , own the stock because you 
 understand that business(circle of competence) , believe in its future(i.e predictability and earning power) and it 
 is available at lower valuations (absolute(DCF) and relative, with more focus on absolute)
--EV/FCF(Market cap + debt - cash&cash equivalents)/Free cash flow Valuation

  4)cyclicals(Auto industry, Travel)
  5)Asset heavy(most of the PSUs)
  6)Turnarounds(Tata consumer products, NBCC,IDFC First bank) - raising from RIP to star 

--------------------- PRESENT --------------------
---Sectoral analysis:
//STAGE of development:
pioneering - EV, green energy
growth - internet
maturity/saturation - FMCG
declining - obselete - TV channels, print media
//Sector value chain : from sourcing to sales entire process and businesses involved must be known (you should always pick companies 
at profitable end of value chain), demand and supply (size of opportunity)
//Market size/Oppurtunity or possible demand for the Sector: it is not about how big a company is, it is about how big a company can get
   only within the country :
        limited to few businesses/limited customer usage
        not limited to a single user (almost every user will find its usage now or eventually)
        not limited to single business (almost every business will find its usage now or eventually)
   global oppurtunity/exports :
        limited to few businesses/limited customer usage
        not limited to a single user (almost every user will find its usage now or eventually)
        not limited to single business (almost every business will find its usage now or eventually)

---Products/services DEMAND check :
//From where does the actual demand from for the company? 
  B2B (client diversification, strong order book - must be volume led growth)
  B2C (how many users out of 140 cr population use it)
  Business service companies (what all industries/companies need it)
  Government
  Global - from which all countries demand come from

//Type of demand
    Infrastructure/Platform - repeat usage including subscripton models
    continous and growing demand - volume led growth reaching to larger audience or more consumption(personal care, healthcare, 
       insurnace, real estate, home furnishing, Energy,Banking and finance)
    continous and replacement/upgradation demand based on latest trends/depreciation - value addition (clothing and footwear, 
        Electronics, Automobile, Telecommunication)
    continous and constant/slow growth demand(FMCG, Food)
    one time demand(capital goods) then growth oppurtunities size should be vast like Praj.Even though Praj establishes the ethanol
     plant, it has huge oppurtunity abroad/huge order backlog both domestic and abroad
    Transition Demand - EV, Renewable Energy, 5G, New Technology - need a lot of research as it can make or break your portfolio

//Capturing sector demand Oppurtunities:
sector demand is growing like Telecom, aviation : even if the company retains its market share and can sustain over the years 
  it can grow effortlessly
sector demand constant like FMCG :  company needs to capture market share from others by providing unique products or enetring in to 
   other FMCG verticals where the company is not even present


---Products/services SUPPLY check :
1)Product portfolio - what all products company manufactures (you can find in investor presentation) - check revenue contribution 
  of each product

2)COMPETETION :  
  existing players - NCDEX, 7.0%
  threat of new entrants - With permissibility and entry of all stock exchanges into commodity space and launch of commodity
     derivatives products by exchanges 

3)Listed peers Comparison: tijori(benchmark) and screener peer comparison sections for profitability and costs

4)Products/services Uniqueness and Quality check :
what makes the product or service of this company Unique?
  //does it delight the customers - when they don't find that product in a store will they go across the street to get it
  //does it own consumers mind(i.e people always remember this company when u talk about a specific product like drink,burger,choc etc)
  //what value does it add to customers compared to competetiors?
  //how is the quality of product/service - Have u used the product/service ? 
    if YES, what is your view 
    if NO, go and open their website, check public review in ecommerce or google search


------------------- FUTURE -----------------
---Goal/Aim that the company wants to achieve and what is the Strategy that it wants to employ?
//Goal/Aim - global leader, capture market share from unorganised players, cleanup stuff and become efficient etc
//Strategies being employed: 
ideally a company that clones other successful strategies is almost bound to win provided it has other necessary qualifications


--- EARNING POWER (Earnings Growth Oppurtunities check )
//SOURCE OF EARNINGS
--Internal Growth oppurtunities
Options on commodity futures
Option in Goods - compulsory physical delivery on settlement date
SEBI green signal for MF and PMS managers to particpate in exchange traded derivatives - an AMC launched the first mutual fund 
  scheme in the country enabling investment in exchange-traded commodity derivatives. Other AMCs too are expected to launch schemes 
  including commodity derivatives in the near future. Such institutional participation in commodity trading and clearing remains
  one of the most promising opportunity 
Spot trading platforms for Bullion, Coal, etc.
electricity derivatives would be linked to spot electricity prices of IEX 

--External Growth oppurtunities
Macroeconomic - check MacroEconomy folder
Tailwinds

---- Sustainability of Earning power: MOATS and Pricing Power to make it a long term bet
1)Competettive advantage/MOAT Check?
Economises of Scale
Low cost producer
Brand
Taste
Network effect
Intangible assets
Switching costs
Entry barriers
Luxury/Premium Range

2)PRICING POWER (MUST HAVE MOAT)

3) Longterm vs short term bet
/Preferred Investment: Both MOATS and Earnings Growth oppurtunities need to exist for sustainable Earnings
/Company with No Moats  but very high growth oppurtunities - a short term buy becuase other competetiors with MOATS can take away the
market share soon - need to monitor closely
/Company with good MOATS but not very good growth oppurtunities - it has become a slow grower(if they genrate a stable free cashflow
you can use the cash to buy other growth and non-growth businesses) 
Note: Don't forget to compare dividend yield with FD interest rates


----Capital Allocation 
//SOURCE OF CAPITAL - Debt/Retained Earnings/New Equity


//USE OF NEW/INCREMENTAL CAPITAL : A good company always uses capital for progressing and next phase growth and not for survival 
Cash
Organic growth - putting back the money in the same business
Inorganic growth - M&A
Dividends
Buyback - preferred
Capex - new
Capex - old PLANT/MACHINERY maintainance (this can't be for ever year meaning sustainence capex is bad for the company)
modernising or technology upgradation of operations
R&D
Advertising
Working capital (tied up in) - bad


//RETURN ON CAPITAL
Good company: ROCE/ROIC(return on capital) > WACC (cost of cpital)
Very Good company: ROCE/ROIC(return on capital) >>> WACC (cost of cpital)
Ideal company : if it can redeploy the incremental capital for same/high returns over time - it becomes a compounding machine

// SUMMARY (Business Quality Check) - decided by PAST, PRESENT and FUTURE of the company
  -Predictable and consistent/recurring EARNINGS for next 10 yrs(MOATS, pricing power)
  -Competes on value rather than price bcoz company that competes on value is like a magnet with stronger magnetic field  that
    attracts customers and companies which compete on price will lose their business to competetiors
  -prefer high margin non commoditized business - if commoditized then must be a low cost producer
  -lousy industry/highly competettive industry/niche industry(no big players have entered yet) ?
  -proxy play on some capital intensive/debt heavy/lousy industry ? 
  -Superior economics (what does company produce, target audience and how does it produce): ESG Principles
   Environmental: does the process/products cause any kind of pollution
   Social: does the products/services add some value to customers or do they waste their time or money or destroy their health
   Governance: Superior Management and board of directors
  -Scalable business model - globally preferred (mutibagger are made because of this property)
  -Company having calibre or potential to adapt to the changing business environment - having said that invest 
    in a business with slow rate of change, rapid change is the enemy of an investor as it needs more capital to adapt and 
    burns more cash to be in the competettion)
  -Having Tailwinds is an added advantage as it boosts the process of wealth creation and helps u in achieving goal faster
  -If a person has lot of money can he break ur business and take away marketshare?
  -Ideal business always takes little amount of capital to operate and an excellent business always
    earns same high returns on incremental capital

check Risk_Check.txt
---Business Risk:
trading activity and volumes should keep growing if it stops then MCX business is gone - like in COVID
if commodity price decreases then the turnover will get affected reducing profits
Policy-related risks - a new tax or increase in the existing rates of taxation will impact MCXâ€™s trading volumes which would have 
  a cascading effect on the clearing volumes, thereby impacting your Companyâ€™s profitability.

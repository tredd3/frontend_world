//Goal/Aim - capture market share from unorganised players
//Strategies being employed: 
discounts and exchange offers

--- EARNING POWER (Earnings Growth Oppurtunities check )
Earning Power is the ability of the company to grow or compound its earnings every year for a very longtime 

---SOURCE OF EARNINGS: earnings source is more than earnings itself bcoz earnings source decides whether the earning growth is 
      sustainable or not, i.e it decides quality of earnings

i)INTERNAL GROWTH OPPURTUNITIES
///Sales Growth led Earnings Growth(every firm needs this kind of growth)     
  1)Demand/Consumption led growth from NEW customers (Volume led growth)
    /penetration - Acquire new customers in untapped and rural areas
    /snatch market share - Acquire customers from competetiors by taking away their market share (organised/unorganised players and 
      does capex to service the demand)
    /Demand shift from other countries like (china+1 startegy) 
  2)Demand/Consumption led growth from OLD customers (Volume led growth)
    /increased consumption(volume led growth) - cutomers buy more variety of products
    /Launch New products - capex and manufacture new products(innovated products/renovated products/premium products)
  3)ONLY Price led Growth (Not preferred at all) - slow growers(very large and matured companies)
    /Increase the price of old product, but increase in volume -  if volumes don't increase after some years your company earnings
    growth rate = inflation(6%) and in the long run as the stock price depends ONLY on earnings, it will also grow at 6%, meaning ur 
    money also grows at 6% and the purpose of investing in stock markets to beat infalation is gone. Also if sales are not increasing 
    then demand has dried up OR competetiors taking away market share - Both are bad situations

///Efficiency led Earnings Growth(few firms have achieved it, they just need to maintain)
    /cost cutting(cannot cut cost beyond a certain point) - increasing operating efficiency and hence margins
    /process optimisation and innovation - chemicals and pharma mainly


---- Sustainability of Earning power: MOATS and Pricing Power to make it a long term bet
1)Competettive advantage/MOAT Check? check MOATS_check.txt
MOAT - is the trait or quality that a business has bcoz of which competettion cannot snatch away its earnings and customers
Economises of Scale - will be achieved soon
Low cost producer - check product quality and profitability ratios
Brand - Indiaâ€™s only company to offer the complete Induction Cooking solution
Taste
Network effect - 620 Prestige Xclusive stores in over 363 cities covering 28 states covering Metros, Mini-Metros, Tier 1,2 & 3.
                    service network 464 centres

Note: Does MOAT Exists? 
  if yes is the MOAT durable, i.e can the company keep its DCA nature for next 10 yrs OR will competetiors snatch away 
   the profits? Imagine and think with a calm mind where do you see this company in the next 10 yrs,
   take in to account, facts and reasoning not opinion
  if NO MOAT what is the 10 yr picture u have in ur mind? will it build one?

2)PRICING POWER (MUST HAVE MOAT)- partly yes
Pricing power implies people are willing to pay premium (can the company increase the product/services prices in the cases
 like inflation and supply chain disruption or in general and be sure that people still buy their products and they don't loose their 
 business to competettion) 
 Proof: if costs increase then sales must increase and GPM trend is either stable or upwards(tijori) 
 This will happen only when :
   i)The product or service is unique and there is hardly any substitute
   ii)NO bargaining power of suppliers: suppliers shouldn't have more bargaining power, if they have then better to own the supplier stocks
     Bargining power of suppliers(low or -ve accounts payable) - critical parts/services suppliers, ONLY producer/supplier of certain products
     Bargining power of company(-ve working capital) - bulk and recurring buy, company with MOATS (as the demand is sustainable)
    Note: Account payables is high meaning company having bargaining power
   iii)NO bargaining power of buyers :
     Bargaining power of buyers(higher inventory days as people always look for bargain in other places, high account recievables as
     the company needs to give the product on credit ) - if client base is limited then company doesn't have a choice but to sell 
     the products at a lower price, if the buyer demands so, especially true for B2B suppliers 
     OR if a company in a highly competettive business (e-commerce, airlines) where people never want to pay premium OR if the 
     product is a commodity (then people always look for low price as value is same across producers)

Note: Pricing power is must for capex heavy companies and companies with large amounts of debt - otherwise they can go Bankruptcy
  and destroy shareholder's wealth during recession.

3) Longterm vs short term bet
/Preferred Investment: Both MOATS and Earnings Growth oppurtunities need to exist for sustainable Earnings
/Company with No Moats  but very high growth oppurtunities - a short term buy becuase other competetiors with MOATS can take away the
market share soon - need to monitor closely
/Company with good MOATS but not very good growth oppurtunities - it has become a slow grower(if they genrate a stable free cashflow
you can use the cash to buy other growth and non-growth businesses) 
Note: Don't forget to compare dividend yield with FD interest rates


----Capital Allocation 
//SOURCE OF CAPITAL - Retained Earnings

---USE OF NEW/INCREMENTAL CAPITAL : 
Organic growth - putting back the money in the same business like meaningful expenses provided you maintain your return ratios(ROE/ROCE/ROIC)
Inorganic growth - M&A for strategic purpose or to build a MOAT
Dividends - most mature companies give out dividends as they don't find better oppurtunities to re-invest profits
Capex - new


//RETURN ON CAPITAL
https://goodcalculators.com/wacc-calculator/
why Return on Capital is important?
Over the longterm the investment returns will always resemble the capital returns

Good company : ROIC/ROCE ~= WACC (i.e on incremental Capital)


// SUMMARY (Business Quality Check) - decided by PAST, PRESENT and FUTURE of the company
  -Predictable and consistent/recurring EARNINGS for next 10 yrs(MOATS, pricing power)
  -Competes on value rather than price bcoz company that competes on value is like a magnet with stronger magnetic field  that
    attracts customers and companies which compete on price will lose their business to competetiors
  -prefer non commoditized business - if commoditized the it must be a low cost producer
  -prefer non-cyclical - if non-cyclical then try enetering at the bottom of the cycle (timing is the key)  
  -lousy industry/highly competettive industry/niche industry(no big players have entered yet) ?
  -proxy play on some capital intensive/debt heavy/lousy industry ? 
  -give high allocation to recession proof stocks(like QSR) , if not how did the company perform during recession years
  -Superior economics (what does company produce, target audience and how does it produce): ESG Principles
   Environmental: does the process/products cause any kind of pollution
   Social: does the products/services add some value to customers or do they waste their time or money or destroy their health
   Governance: Superior Management and board of directors
  -Scalable business model - globally preferred (mutibagger are made because of this property)
  -Company having calibre or potential to adapt to the changing business environment - having said that invest 
    in a business with slow rate of change, rapid change is the enemy of an investor as it needs more capital to adapt and 
    burns more cash to be in the competettion)
  -Having Tailwinds is an added advantage as it boosts the process of wealth creation and helps u in achieving goal faster
  -If a person has lot of money can he break ur business and take away marketshare?
  -Ideal business always takes little amount of capital to operate and an excellent business always
    earns same high returns on incremental capital


------------------------------ FINANCIAL STRENGTH CHECK --------------------------
check Financial_Strength_Check.txt
--expenses breakup and see which expenses are growing YOY

//Financial strengths
Zero debt and high cash - meaning acquisitions can be funded by cash
very strong balance sheet

//Financial weakness
Avg profitability

------------------------------ MANAGEMENT CHECK --------------------------------
//how is the Management and their Vision: check management discussion analysis in annual report
promoters are also non-executive directors
Focus: Growth and efficiency (more towards make in India and supporting local communities)


----------------------------------- RISKS ----------------------------------------
check Risk_Check.txt
---Business Risk:
discounts throughout the year
The target audience reduces significantly beacuse a family of avg 5 people use the same product
raw material prices volatility
changing consumer trends and any lag in innovation can impact growth
intense competetion from unorganized sector and irrational discounting by regional brands


---Financial Risk:
low numbers - becuase the usage is per family not per person

---Management Risk:

---Investment Returns Risk:

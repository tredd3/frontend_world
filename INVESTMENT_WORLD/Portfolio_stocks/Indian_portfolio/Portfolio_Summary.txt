------------------------------- Category C ---------------------------------
Turnarounds OR
Little pricing power OR 
Highly competettive Industry OR
Fortunes depend on other industry

Alkyl Amines - better than balaji amines in financials, Niche market with oligopoly and little market size , so no market share 
  gain oppurtunities, Export is difficult because of transportation, competettion from china but most of their production is for
  captive consumption

-------------------------------- Eliminated -----------------------------------
Radico - ESG concerns won't bring in much funds , institutional holding is already high and states control everything from production
   to prices, taxes etc - they can ban liquor anytime they want

IRCTC - no pricing power , Puppet in the hands of Railways (ok for a short term buy if valuations improve)

TTK Prestige - good balance sheet, but Avg ROE(15%) and NPM (10%) - weaker economics (only few products of Prestige has
  brand loyalty + replacement time is high and target audience reduces to poulation/5, i.e families)

MTAR - equity grwth is zero and ROE is less, bargaining power of consumers exists bcoz of the limited clients, Govt is the major
  customer hence working capital cycle is high, not globally diversified, no oppurtunities of market share gain

BSE - we can hold it when dividend yield is attractive, no reinvestment of cashflow

MCX - cyclical and completely unpredictable , no growth opputunities as it is already a monopoly and NO Global scope, 
   ZERO pricing power as SEBI and Govt interferes

CDSL - macroeconomic oppurtunity, but suseptible to market cycles because most o the revenues are linked to transaction,
       lower end of value chain, SEBI controls the pricing. No Global expansion oppurtunities, cash generated is given as dividends
       as there are no oppurtunities to deploy, since it already holds 50% market share and it cannot put money in non-core 
       business. Also it Better to play with consumption rather than investing of individuals as 75% Indian population is poor

CAMS  - over the years MF transaction will only increase , SIP amount will increase but not decrease
       but pricing power is not in hands of CAMS and revenue model is volume based pricing, also the rate at which revenues

highly competettive industry - hence margins not under control
any new person with lot of money can disrupt this business - as there is no differentiation that Saregama provides
unpredictable - never know which song will be a hit, which movie will be a hit
low margin business (Hence profits from frequently played songs will cover the losses for other songs and profits/margins will always be less)

DrLalPathlabs - 
company has not increased prices much in 5 years because of intense competition in this industry and focussed majorly on volumes.
commoditised
any person with large capital can compete in this business and offer lesser price

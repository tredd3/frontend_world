//Category B - eligible for capital infusion but needs close observation on business and financial performance

IDFC First Bank - turnaround with strong management, infra debt slowly decreasing, innovative products like BNPL, monthly interest
MapmyIndia - macroeconomic oppurtunity with first mover advantage
Happiest Minds - niche IT services, low institutional ownership , strong promoter but limited pricing power because of high
  competettion, financials improved in the last 3yrs(during covid times) and valuation is bit high
CAMS  - over the years MF transaction will only increase , SIP amount will increase but not decrease
       but pricing power is not in hands of CAMS and revenue model is volume based pricing, also the rate at which revenues
       will grow is also lower because CAMS is a the lower end of value chain and earns very little amount(0.0001%) of the 
       transaction amount
CRISIL - high valuations, repeat and fixed customers

//Category C - stop further infusion of money
GLS - Level 2 screening

        but PEG is 7.33 extremely high valuations

NYKAA - very high valuations
page industries - dividend play + very high valuations (Level 2 screening to check growth and future plans)

       lower end of value chain, SEBI controls the pricing

//Eliminated
Radico - ESG concerns won't bring in much funds , institutional holding is already high and states control everything from production
   to prices, taxes etc - they can ban liquor anytime they want
IRCTC - no pricing power , Puppet in the hands of Railways (ok for a short term buy if valuations improve)
Paypal - All equity is spent on acquisitions at higher cost - subsidaries must perform
TTK Prestige - good balance sheet, but Avg ROE(15%) and NPM (10%) - weaker economics (only few products of Prestige has
  brand loyalty + replacement time is high and target audience reduces to poulation/5, i.e families)
MTAR - equity grwth is zero and ROE is less, bargaining power of consumers exists bcoz of the limited clients, B2B
BSE - we can hold it when dividend yield is attractive, no reinvestment of cashflow
MCX - cyclical and completely unpredictable , no growth opputunities as it is already a monopoly and NO Global scope, 
   ZERO pricing power as SEBI and Govt interferes

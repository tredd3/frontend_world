    Store format: company-owned, company-managed (inventory owned by company and franchisee operated), and franchisee stores with 
      increasing focus on franchise stores going forward. Hence, large-scale retail space additions do not result in heavy capex

promoters: joint-venture between TATA Group and Tamilnadu Industrial Development Corporation (TIDCO)
why did the promoters start the business: to capture the huge oppurtunity insome industry/sector OR passion
any research report/youtube analysis available for the company: 
what peter lynch bucket does stock belongs to : slow growers/stalwarts/fast growers/cyclicals/asset heavy/turover(special situation)

  2)stalwarts - 10-15% revenue growth (TataElixi, IEX)
  3)Fast Growers (Praj)
  4)cyclicals(Auto industry, Travel)
  5)Asset heavy(most of the PSUs)
  6)Turnarounds(Tata consumer products, NBCC,IDFC First bank) - raising from RIP to star 

--------------------- PRESENT --------------------
---Sectoral analysis:
//STAGE of development: growth
//Sector value chain : from sourcing to sales entire process and businesses involved must be known (you should always pick companies 
at profitable end of value chain), demand and supply (size of opportunity)
//Market size/Oppurtunity or possible demand for the Sector: it is not about how big a company is, it is about how big a company can get
   only within the country :
        limited to few businesses/limited customer usage
        not limited to a single user (almost every user will find its usage now or eventually)
        not limited to single business (almost every business will find its usage now or eventually)
   global oppurtunity/exports :
        limited to few businesses/limited customer usage
        not limited to a single user (almost every user will find its usage now or eventually)
        not limited to single business (almost every business will find its usage now or eventually)

---Products/services DEMAND check :
//From where does the actual demand from for the company? 
  B2C (how many users out of 140 cr population use it) - mostly all women will eventually use it
  Global - in pipeline

//Type of demand: continous and replacement/upgradation demand based on latest trends
//Capturing sector demand Oppurtunities:
sector demand is growing like Telecom, aviation : even if the company retains its market share and can sustain over the years 
  it can grow effortlessly
sector demand constant like FMCG :  company needs to capture market share from others by providing unique products or enetring in to 
   other FMCG verticals where the company is not even present


---Products/services SUPPLY check :
1)Product portfolio :
Tanishq(premium) - formal/wedding jewellery
Zoya(Luxury) - exquisite jewellery in diamonds and precious stones
Mia(mid market) is trendy, focused on working woman, thus minimal modern, every day, office wear designs
Caratlane(mid market) - party wear, gifts
Titan eye plus - It also owns licenses many brands for frames and glasses
Watches (fastrack, sonata(mass market), titan, (premium)) - joint venture with MONTO BLANC & possesses licenses of several 
  international brands such as Tommy Hilfiger, Police, Anne Klein, Kenneth Cole & COACH
Taneria - women ethinic wear mainly sarees
SKINN - french fragrances at a very attractive price point

2)COMPETETION :  Never look for companies that doesn't have competetion, always prefer companies that sustained competettion with their 
             MOATS bcoz someday or the other competettion is bound to come if it is a high margin business. At the same time Never 
             invest in a business that is present in a highly competettive industry that competes ONLY on price instead of value
  what is the unlisted players market share - 
  listed peers market share -
  postion among peers - 
  global competettion - imports risk from china or any other low cost producer country?
  threat of new entrants

3)Listed peers Comparison: tijori(benchmark) and screener peer comparison sections for profitability and costs

4)Products/services Uniqueness and Quality check :
what makes the product or service of this company Unique?
  //does it delight the customers - when they don't find that product in a store will they go across the street to get it
  //does it own consumers mind(i.e people always remember this company when u talk about a specific product like drink,burger,choc etc)
  //what value does it add to customers compared to competetiors?
  //how is the quality of product/service - Have u used the product/service ? 
    if YES, what is your view 
    if NO, go and open their website, check public review in ecommerce or google search


------------------- FUTURE -----------------
---Goal/Aim that the company wants to achieve and what is the Strategy that it wants to employ?
//Goal/Aim - global leader, capture market share from unorganised players, cleanup stuff and become efficient etc
//Strategies being employed: 
ideally a company that clones other successful strategies is almost bound to win provided it has other necessary qualifications


--- EARNING POWER (Earnings Growth Oppurtunities check )
//SOURCE OF EARNINGS
--Internal Growth oppurtunities
Tanisq -  open (more) stores in smaller towns
International expansion of Zoya, Taneria, Tanishq
Platinum is also expected to be a huge opportunity and Titan is building capability for that.
wedding - regionalisation (specific jewellery for a given region is being launched)
market share capture from unorganised players(probable)
Taneria expansion via franchisee model (current revenues 250cr  out of total market of 50,000 cr)

--External Growth oppurtunities
Macroeconomic - 
Huge headroom for growth with just 6% market share in Rs4trn jewellery market. Much more headroom in wedding, studded and high value jewellery.


---- Sustainability of Earning power: MOATS and Pricing Power to make it a long term bet
1)Competettive advantage/MOAT Check?
Brand
Network effect
Luxury/Premium Range - exited from LFS, CSD due to discount nature of business
Caratlane - high margin and low investment business , targetting global indian diaspora

2)PRICING POWER (MUST HAVE MOAT)

3) Longterm vs short term bet
/Preferred Investment: Both MOATS and Earnings Growth oppurtunities need to exist for sustainable Earnings
/Company with No Moats  but very high growth oppurtunities - a short term buy becuase other competetiors with MOATS can take away the
market share soon - need to monitor closely
/Company with good MOATS but not very good growth oppurtunities - it has become a slow grower(if they genrate a stable free cashflow
you can use the cash to buy other growth and non-growth businesses) 
Note: Don't forget to compare dividend yield with FD interest rates


----Capital Allocation 
//SOURCE OF CAPITAL - Debt/Retained Earnings/New Equity


//USE OF NEW/INCREMENTAL CAPITAL : A good company always uses capital for progressing and next phase growth and not for survival 
Cash
Organic growth - putting back the money in the same business
Inorganic growth - M&A
Dividends
Buyback - preferred
Capex - new
Capex - old PLANT/MACHINERY maintainance (this can't be for ever year meaning sustainence capex is bad for the company)
modernising or technology upgradation of operations
R&D
Advertising
Working capital (tied up in) - bad


//RETURN ON CAPITAL
Good company: ROCE/ROIC(return on capital) > WACC (cost of cpital)
Very Good company: ROCE/ROIC(return on capital) >>> WACC (cost of cpital)
Ideal company : if it can redeploy the incremental capital for same/high returns over time - it becomes a compounding machine

// SUMMARY (Business Quality Check) - decided by PAST, PRESENT and FUTURE of the company
  -Predictable and consistent/recurring EARNINGS for next 10 yrs(MOATS, pricing power)
  -Competes on value rather than price bcoz company that competes on value is like a magnet with stronger magnetic field  that
    attracts customers and companies which compete on price will lose their business to competetiors
  -prefer high margin non commoditized business - if commoditized then must be a low cost producer
  -is it recession proof ? how did it perform in 2008 and 2020 crisis
    Note : high debt or high capex companies can go bust during recession or high inflatory situations(if no pricing power)
  -lousy industry/highly competettive industry/niche industry(no big players have entered yet) ?
  -proxy play on some capital intensive/debt heavy/lousy industry ? 
  -Superior economics (what does company produce, target audience and how does it produce): ESG Principles
   Environmental: does the process/products cause any kind of pollution
   Social: does the products/services add some value to customers or do they waste their time or money or destroy their health
   Governance: Superior Management and board of directors
  -Scalable business model - globally preferred (mutibagger are made because of this property)
  -Company having calibre or potential to adapt to the changing business environment - having said that invest 
    in a business with slow rate of change, rapid change is the enemy of an investor as it needs more capital to adapt and 
    burns more cash to be in the competettion)
  -Having Tailwinds is an added advantage as it boosts the process of wealth creation and helps u in achieving goal faster
  -If a person has lot of money can he break ur business and take away marketshare?
  -Ideal business always takes little amount of capital to operate and an excellent business always
    earns same high returns on incremental capital

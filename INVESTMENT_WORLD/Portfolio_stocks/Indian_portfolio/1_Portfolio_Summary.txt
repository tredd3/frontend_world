Jubiliant food works - generate cash and use the cash to expand stores, solo licensee for dominos in India and neighbouring countries,

Berger Paints - like Asian paints it has cracked the code to sustain and be successful in paints industry (i.e dealers inventory

----------------------------- Contra portfolio ----------------------------------

IGL/GGL - CDG companies, reducing gas prices is +ve for these companies - especially with govt push to increase gas share in energy

  gain oppurtunities, Export is difficult because of transportation, competettion from china but most of their production is for

------------------------------- VC portfolio ---------------------------------
Turnarounds OR
sunrise industry OR

Financials: almost negligble debt, ROCE 21%
MOATS :
Management/Promoter : MD is a chemical engineer from IIT & Stanford, he is also the promoter
Strengths : low profit base
Risks : 
   intense competettion from players like asian and berger, unorganised players
   almost no pricing power
Valuation :

Tarsons - Very good financials, Transition from Glassware to plasticware - giving scope for double digit volume
Borosil Renewables - macroeconomic oppurtunity both in india and europe, but no pricing power as prices are decided globally
Moldtek Packaging - CFO used in capex, 25% constant ROCE on incremental capital, globally competettive - No, Credit Rating :  A+
 strong clients and oppurtunity for market share gain
Galaxy surfactants - CFO used in capex, divdends | 25% constant ROCE on incremental capital, Credit Rating : AA-, Proxy play on 
world FMCG market , focusing on transistion demand from petro to oleo chemicals , moderate pricing power bcoz of competettion
Suprajit - lower end of value chain, but will volumes be double digit? need to findout
Rajratan Global wires - lower end of value chain , fluctuating margins as prices are linked to steel, competettion from China
   but will volumes be double digit? need to findout
AU small finance bank/AAVAS financers/HOME FIRST/FIVE STAR - home, MSME lending (strong small players with good asset quality 
  even in COVID)
  FIVE STAR - spread in south
  AAVAS financers - Rajasthan, Maharastra etc
  HOME FIRST - Gujarat, Maharastra
  

-------------------------------- Eliminated -----------------------------------
Radico - ESG concerns won't bring in much funds , institutional holding is already high and states control everything from production
   to prices, taxes etc - they can ban liquor anytime they want

IRCTC - no pricing power , Puppet in the hands of Railways (ok for a short term buy if valuations improve)

TTK Prestige - good balance sheet, but Avg ROE(15%) and NPM (10%) - weaker economics (only few products of Prestige has
  brand loyalty + replacement time is high and target audience reduces to poulation/5, i.e families)

MTAR - equity grwth is zero and ROE is less, bargaining power of consumers exists bcoz of the limited clients, Govt is the major
  customer hence working capital cycle is high, not globally diversified, orders acquired via bidding - no pricing power

MCX - cyclical and completely unpredictable , no growth opputunities as it is already a monopoly and NO Global scope, 
   ZERO pricing power as SEBI and Govt interferes

CDSL, BSE - macroeconomic oppurtunity, but suseptible to market cycles because most of the revenues are linked to transaction,
       lower end of value chain, SEBI controls the pricing. No Global expansion oppurtunities, cash generated is given as dividends
       as there are no oppurtunities to deploy, since it already holds 50% market share and it cannot put money in non-core 
       business. Also it Better to play with consumption rather than investing of individuals as 75% Indian population is poor

CAMS  - over the years MF transaction will only increase , SIP amount will increase and not decrease
       but pricing power is not in hands of CAMS and revenue model is volume based pricing, also the rate at which revenues
       will grow is also lower because CAMS is a the lower end of value chain and earns very little amount(0.0001%) of the 
       transaction amount, Not globally scalable, No market share gain oppurtunity as it already has highest share 

CRISIL - high valuations, repeat and fixed customers, CFO used in dividends, decreasing ROCE on incremental capital, 
  globally competettive - Yes but i purchased the shares of its parent SPGI which is a 65% shareholder of CRISIL
  Also CRISIL dividends partially cover the expenses of SPGI, SPGI does share buyback & acquistion apart from dollar appreciation
  of the investment

Saregama - capital intensive business(with upfront payment) - over the years , the catelogue gets old &  people always need fresh songs
highly competettive industry - hence margins not under control
any new person with lot of money can disrupt this business - as there is no differentiation that Saregama provides
unpredictable - never know which song will be a hit, which movie will be a hit
low margin business (Hence profits from frequently played songs will cover the losses for other songs and profits/margins will always be less)

DrLalPathlabs - 
company has not increased prices much in 5 years because of intense competition in this industry and focussed majorly on volumes.
commoditised
any person with large capital can compete in this business and offer lesser price
Most of the complex tests are done in hospital 
no export oppurtunities
if it enters B2B market with hospital chains - they need to provide discounts
unless there is tech and scale - it is difficult for dr lal to get high margins
Note: we invest in Tarsons, proxy to diagnostic companies

Balkrishna Industries - limited pricing power as said by management, heavily dependent on Europe & US volumes 
        Other established companies are also present in this area - along with on road tyre presence  
        +ves - low labour cost, 
Note: we invest in rajratan global wire, proxy to tyre companies

IEX - NO pricing power - rates controlled by power board, globally competettive - No, new competettion came in the picture, 
  companies preferring captive power consumption, long term power agreements to secure supply chain

KRBL - fully integrated basmati rice producer.
Also has non-basmati rice portfolio
use of cash : establish rice mills in Gujarat, Maharashtra and Karnataka +  Dividend + buyback 
Has captive power plants (using rice husk to produce power)
By-products such as rice bran are effectively utilised for producing Rice Bran Oil, Furfural Oil, Furfural Alcohol, Cattle feed etc
Focus on premium portfolio for exports - although they also have mass segment 
Ethanol opportunity with broken rice ?
Risks: no pricing power due to commodity nature of business, low sector growth rate, Govt can ban exports and 
  import country regulations (meaning no control on volumes and price), cyclical cashflows due to rice prices
  inventory can lose value
  export duty can make rice costly to importers compared to other global suppliers

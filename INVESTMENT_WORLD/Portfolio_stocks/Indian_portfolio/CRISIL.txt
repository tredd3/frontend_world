------------------- SCREENING SUMMARY -------------------
//General check:
  stock picking strategy: bottoms-up/top-down/cloning/contratian/familiar with the product or industry/profits going down due to 
     capacity to suffer/suggestion from youtuber or broker
  Normal check on stock price since inception - google search (any abnormal increase or decrease in share price?)
  Abnormal falling: google search why a company share is falling - check Why_Stock_Price_Falling.txt
  Abnormal increase: EPS, PE, manipulation(FII/DII buying at random prices taking share 
    prices up and lock  retail folks at higher prices OR buying via shell companies inflating 
    the share price naturally like Adani once did)
  legal orders(confirm from wiki) and tickertape
  Recent News from tickertape
  corporate actions, dividend history and announcements from tickertape
  check shareholding pattern(especially promoter) trend over the years in tijori
    Promoter holding : higher is the better
    Institutional ownership: lower is the better because if the company performs well they keep buying it and share price takes off
  promoter pledging
  Is the business easy to understand or complex : easy/complex
  circle of competence: Yes/No
  any recent insider buying (bse india > disclosures > insider trading) OR Value Research(ownership section) for US stocks
  (Especially if normal employees are buying apart form promoters/top management then its a positive sign as they know better
     than any broker/analyst/investor)
  any bulk or block deals (to discover price?

//Business check:
  screener pros and cons
  market share trend
  //how is the quality of product/service - Have u used the product/service ? 
    if YES, what is your view 
    if NO, go and open their website, check public review in ecommerce or google search
  CRISIL Rating must be Above A and check Rating History for last 3 Years - upgraded from BBB to A-
  can a fool run this business
  can you put 50% of your net worth, buy the whole business and forget about it for next 5-10 yrs ???
   assuming that stock market is closed for next 5-10yrs are you ok holding the entire business without knowing its price every year?
  for longterm : don't invest in a stock just bcoz the stock price will increase, invest because you want to own that business

//Finance check:
1)Balance sheet Strength check
--Equity/Total assets (liabilities should be as less as possible for a strong balance sheet)
--(Price to book value) - 5 (not an asset play)

//non-current assets - <value>
-if Goodwill is more on the assets side but the acquired companies are not able to generate profits then Book value significantly 
  decreases because people won't buy the company or value the company for the price at which u have bought
-intangible assets that help u in creating some value or they themselves have some value that others are willing to pay is fine else
  they also can loose value like crazy
-long term investments (won't lose value but depends on the investment if it is a business and doing bad it might lose value) -
  u need to check notes to consolidated financial statements

//Net current assets -<value>
-cash , land and  financial investments won't lose value - indicating that the balance sheet is strong
-inventory as % of total assets - can quickly lose value depending on the type of inventory like fashion will quickly lose it,
  but raw materials will not 
--check current assets(mainly cash) compared to current liabilities - bcoz if current liabilities > current assets then u need to 
  sell non current-assets to clear them or take loan (both are bad)

//shareholder Equity -<value>
--Check Equity CAGR from balance sheet equity section 
   if it is constant then check dividend section in cashflow analysis bcoz company might be giving out its earnings as dividend OR 
     (check share capital section where company might be doing buyback)
   if it is decreasing then it MUST be only from buybacks (if not company is doing something wrong it is losing/selling its assets)
   if equity is increasing check ROE trend
--Sorce of Equity increase: to find this out balance sheet should be studied in tally with cash flow statement
 Sustainable:  cash flow from operations(goes in to retained earnings) 
 Non-sustainable(one-off): cash from from investments(goes in to retained earnings) and financing activities(goes into share 
  capital, u need to check EPS trend)

//non-current Liabilities - <value>


2)Profit and loss statement
--sales growth consistent and increasing?
--operating profit +ve  most of the time and growing?
--earnings quality check : core business vs other income contribution to profits over the years?
--interest expense >40-50% of operating profit?
--net income consistently +ve and growing? 
  
3)Cashflow statement
--operating cash flow must be atleast 70-80% of  operating profit 
--CFO +ve most of the time and growing?
--free cash flow consistently +ve and growing?
Note: if free cash flow is -ve check why
free cash flow -ve bcoz of operating cash flow => company is bad and in-efficienct
free cash flow -ve bcoz of capex => is it doing continous capex(10 yr check cash flow analysis)
--use of cash flow from operations: check 10yr cash flow analysis in tijori (preferrence is reinvestment)
//check cashflow from financing section
-- if debt is increasing u need to check the usage of debt in investment section or is to cover Operating loses?
-- if equity is increasing?  (if yes EPS should also increase)

4)Profitability Ratios Check:
--GPM(consistent and above 15%) trend - company has Pricing power 
--OPM(consistent and above 15%) trend - company has Efficient management 
--NPM(consistent and above 15%) trend - good profitability
Note: if NPM is less then check Asset turnover ratio, if both are less than ROE is less and you need to avoid that business
--ROE consistent and  10-15% (with D/E under control)? ROE is the real return as this indicates that owners wealth is being compounded 
--ROCE(consistent and above 15%) trend - return on capital is good than cost of capital
--ROIC(consistent and above 15%) trend- company is generating enough cash in its core business
--check D/E trend ?
if D/E > 0 check in the balance sheet if the long term debt is increasing ?
can long term debt can be cleared by earnings of 4 yrs?(look at debt/Profit metrics in screener)

 //Valuation check
Price is different Valuation is different, just bcoz stock is falling doesn't mean it is cheap(earnings might be falling too)
Price - is what people pay for the business
Valuation is price compared to earnings 
Note: Don't invest in a stock because the price has fallen and you think the price will increase , own the stock because you 
 understand that business(circle of competence) , believe in its future(i.e predictability and earning power) and it 
 is available at lower valuations (absolute(DCF) and relative, with more focus on absolute)
--EV/FCF(Market cap + debt - cash&cash equivalents)/Free cash flow Valuation

1)Fact: disruptions can create winners even among traditional players 
Assumption: it will wipe out all the existing players

2)Fact: For a company to grow it doesn't need to be in a growing sector
It can also grow in a slow growing sector by capturing the market share
for example: relaxo footwear is not in a high growing industry but it is a high growth company as 
 it captures market share from unorganised players

3)having debt is not danger, if u know how to leverage it 
E.g: take debt and invest in real estate/for acquiring companies - now the cash generated is used to repay the EMI and after 
  few years when the whole loan is repaid, that investment is yours.
Moreover EMI amount always remains the same for the whole loan period but the cash generated from investments keep 
  on increasing, which means you can clear the loan much before its tenure

4)Three kinds of people in the market: realists(logical, facts), optimists(greed) and pessimists(fear)
Intelligent investor is always a realist, who buys from pesssimists and sells to optimists
Since he is a realist he follows news rigorously to inculcate the reality in his imagination

5)Reality can be more often be discovered by believing ur brain and not ur eyes

6)price is what you pay and value is what you get - this is applicable through out your life 

7)compounding effect is applicable eve in real life, in terms of workout, knowledge
E.g: u keep gaining knowledge and understanding things, for the first few yrs it is might be difficult
for you but for the next few years it will be easy because the amount of knowledge acquired over the years is huge.

8)There will also be times when you do not find many good ideas to invest in. During the dry investment periods turn to reading.
Because sometimes the best thing to do in the market is to sit and watch

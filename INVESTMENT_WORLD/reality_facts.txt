Golden facts: 
//Sometimes fundamentals and stock price move in opposite direction for short term.
  so if fundamentals are good and stock price is down (it could be a potential buy based on valuations)
  similary if price is way above earning power then correction is expected
//people working in a given industry or customers using the products will have an EDGE compared to wall street professionals
 Employees/Owners will know the developments in a sector/company much before and in a much better way than the professionals
 Customers will know the product quality and service as they have been using it for a while

1)Fact: disruptions can create winners even among traditional players 
Assumption: it will wipe out all the existing players

2)Fact: For a company to grow it doesn't need to be in a growing sector
It can also grow in a slow growing sector by capturing the market share
for example: relaxo footwear is not in a high growing industry but it is a high growth company as 
 it captures market share from unorganised players

3)having debt is not danger, if u know how to leverage it 
E.g: take debt and invest in real estate/for acquiring companies - now the cash generated is used to repay the EMI and after 
  few years when the whole loan is repaid, that investment is yours.
Moreover EMI amount always remains the same for the whole loan period but the cash generated from investments keep 
  on increasing, which means you can clear the loan much before its tenure

4)Three kinds of people in the market: realists(logical, facts), optimists(greed) and pessimists(fear)
Intelligent investor is always a realist, who buys from pesssimists and sells to optimists
Since he is a realist he follows news rigorously to inculcate the reality in his imagination

5)Reality can be more often be discovered by believing ur brain and not ur eyes

6)price is what you pay and value is what you get - this is applicable through out your life 

7)compounding effect is applicable eve in real life, in terms of workout, knowledge
E.g: u keep gaining knowledge and understanding things, for the first few yrs it is might be difficult
for you but for the next few years it will be easy because the amount of knowledge acquired over the years is huge.

8)There will also be times when you do not find many good ideas to invest in. During the dry investment periods turn to reading.
Because sometimes the best thing to do in the market is to sit and watch

9)Assmption not necessarily true or sometimes they will never be true
-It's gone down this much already it can't go much lower
-you can predict when did the stock hit the bottom
-if it's already gone high that it can't go higher (but if the story is good, fundamentals haven't changed, earnings are improving 
then there is no reason why stock price won't go up as stock price in the long run always follows EARNINGS)
e.g: stocks that are already a 20 bagger still have become further 10 bagger only because of earning power
-when it rebounds back i will sell - if you are not confident about the business then sell immediately else might end up having 
 more losses
-conservative stocks won't fluctuate (economy and regualtory troubles can make them down by 50% but they will quickly rebound)

10)just because a stock is down 20% the next day you bought doesn't mean it bad investment, similarly if it is up 20% the next 
day also doesn't mean the investment is good - it all about the long term short term price changes doesn't matter it's the 
underlying business strength and earning power of the company that matters

11)Instead of buying next Disney, next Walmart at bargain price, its better to buy the original companies at a fair price.
Because 95% of the time the so called the next companies might not be the actual next companies

12)Don't study great businesses ONLY for the purpose of investing - understand the process and journey of becoming great ,
lot of success and failure lessons can be learned and applied to other businesses in the same sector

13)Eliminate Human bias: Just because you studied and analysed the business say for a month, that doesn't mean you will buy it
you might study 100 businesses and invest in say only 5 or 10 businesses


-------- big people moves explained ----------
why stocks like zomato/Paytm get so much attention from investors?
Reason: ability to carry forward operating losses. Once they start becoming profitable they don't have to pay taxes for next 
  couple of years and hence EPS keeps growing

why people hold low profit margin stocks ?
if the sales increases more than the costs, if you do the math say for e.g: sales increases 10%, costs increases 5%
then EPS for a low profit margin company increases 3X but for high profit margin company it does increase 0.5X and hence the 
share price follows multiplying their money 3 times

why they even own companies with high D/E?
Equity is costly(15% expectations from shareholders), Debt is cheap(max 10%)
hence if Debt used wisely can significantly increase ROE and proftability of the company

***** Sectors (semi active) ***** 
****WHEN TO INVEST: depending on the economic cycle, during burst period or recovery phase
Phases of Economy -
Burst to Boom:
Phase 1: RBI focuses on growth and decreases bank interest rates => people/companies take loan and spend => increase in demand. Most of the public spends it on home and vehicles.
Impacted sectors => banks(income increases), auto and real-estate (sales increase)
Problems :
Banks - NPA mess
Auto - supply is more but demand is not getting created
Infra - supply is more but demand is not getting created 
Phase 2: To counter the demand generated in phase 1  and to help increase supply Govt spends on Infrastructure(rail, road, aviation, power) => Job creation => further  increase in demand
Companies can now focus only on core business, supply is met quickly and also job creation
Phase 3: commodity(soft - agriculture, hard - metals, raw materials for construction) - as lot of jobs and demand is created in the previous phase commodity sector grows fast => economy enters boom peak (inflation at peak) =>if RBI doesnâ€™t control inflation at this stage it can lead to hyper-inflation and economy will collapse => hence RBI increases interest rates and demand decreases
Boom to Burst :
Phase 4: Invest in FMCG, Pharma and Gold (as they are stable sectors)

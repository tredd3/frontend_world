***** Tax saving instruments *******
Elss + NPS is preferred 
After 3 years Matured ELSS principal will be re-invested in to tax saving and the returns are invested in to equity.
Which means only 1.5*3 yrs = 4.5 lakhs will be invested in to elss  for your whole life for tax saving.
NPS Vs PPF - choose NPS for longterm
Nifty Vs NPS 
Nifty in long term: Compounding advantage > tax advantage
NPS in short term:Tax advantage > compounding advantage

//Tax saving trick on stock profits
Instead of holding it for many yrs and then selling it off
Better sell it until ur profit is 1 lakh and rebuy ur shares next day(if u buy it on the same day it will be treated as intra day trading hence don’t it)
In this way u can save almost 30,000 per yr which is a huge amount
Also better to have multiple accounts to save tax legally

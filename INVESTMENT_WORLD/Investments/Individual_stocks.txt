EXCELLENT businesses at FAIR Price instead of FAIR businesses at excellent Price
Golden rules:
Be a value investor and not a growth investor
Growth investor - invests in companies which might click and turn in to a great business fetching great returns. But if it collapses u will loose ur capital
Value investor - invests in those companies where u might not get great returns but u will never loose ur capital even in tough times.
Also in the longterm compounding effect will provide you excellent benefits
1)if u Buy Bad companies at better price(risk of losing capital)
Instead Buy Great companies at a good price/valuation
2)Stay in your circle of competence - invest in industries which you understand or believe
3)Invest in predictable/steady businesses like biscuits, ice creams etc so that u can estimate and discount the future cash flows and come up with a fair valuation 
Investing in unpredictable businesses like newspaper, auto sector ,technology etc might result in lose of capital
4)Short term - PE is significant(speculator focus), long term - earnings are significant(investor focus)
5)Invest in Companies that runs solely on the kind of business/products and not because of a person

*******GOOD dividend paying companies ******
Companies which not only pay good dividend but also their dividend payment increases every yr
* Net profit/income increasing for last 5 yrs?
*  Check if the EPS has grown in last 5 years.
* Also check if DPS - dividend per share has grown in last 5 years.
* Compare if EPS growth and dividend per share growth are similar.
* Dividend yield can sometimes be misleading, i.e if share price decreases dividend yield seems to be high
* Dividend payout should also be more
Moral of the story: It is important to look at dividend yield, but in conjunction with other fundamentals like sales, profit, EPS, dividend payout %, etc.
Also reinvest the dividend in other dividend paying stocks

***** Company Valuation ******
//Valuation Terminology:
**capital: equity +debt
**Market cap is the total value of all outstanding shares of the company's stock. It is calculated by multiplying the stock's current share price and the number of shares outstanding.
Market cap gives you an idea of the growth and risk to expect from a particular stock. Companies are classified according to market capitalization. 
The broad categories are large-, mid-, and small-cap.
Large-cap companies are well-established successful companies with steady streams of revenue. Their growth over time may be slow but steady. 
small-cap stocks are those that are experiencing accelerated growth, but that
**Enterprise value(EV) is a more accurate measure of a company's real worth because it takes into consideration its debt obligations. 
EV = market_cap +  outstanding preferred stock + all debt(short and long term) - all of its cash and cash equivalents.
i.e if u want to buy a company, u need to pay the shareholders, lenders. However u will get the cash held by company

//financial ratios  compare with the company 10yrs performance, competitors and industry to know the actual value/performance
1)P/E <  20 - no need to check growth
PE > 20 -  check if growth is fast and PEG < 1.3
If a company’s PE is more that means investor is paying premium bcoz it’s a high growth industry and assuming that potential earnings growth will be more
How to know whether this premium is justified? 
PEG=PE/CAGR(Growth in net profit/net income/free cash flow for last 10 yrs)
All B2C companies should be valued based on PE (FMCG) and not on PB
NOTE :
low P/E might not mean company is undervalued, company may be bankrupt in few years or their future may be skeptical or some negative news which might impact the business
High P/E might not mean market is paying a premium price bcoz of positive sentiment, it can also mean earnings are less.
Conclusion: Both high and low P/E has flaws, so focus on the earnings 
2)D/E - debt to equity should be < 0.5 
If D/E is high and if earnings decreases bcoz of business/economy slowdown then company will collapse and you will loose the capital
if it is low then and ur shareholder base increases is also bad (as the money gets distributed lifetime) as Equity is costly(lifetime dividend payment from profits), debt is cheap(one time clearance)
Reasons for Less debt: 
** no growth plans
** no one is giving u debt bcoz of less credit worthiness
** company is strong enough to finance all its future needs - required
For Great companies - D/E is 0 
3)ROE - return on equity - net profit/total equity - rate at which equity/shareholders money grows 
ROE should be  > 15% else better to invest in index funds
4)P/B - market value per share to book value per share
ROE and P/B must be in sync 
Book value/net worth/net assets/equity= total assets - liabilities (Intangible assets such as patents,copyrights, brand recognition, and goodwill are not included in the balance sheet)
in simple words book value is what shareholders get after company is liquidated/sold and it's liabilities are paid off
When to buy based on PB: for a new company where earnings haven’t begun, B2B(ONGC,GAIL) exceptions for companies like L&T, Intel bcoz they established a sense of trust in customers
PB value should be < 1.5 for great valuation
5)free cash flow = owner’s earnings =Net Cash flow from Operating activities(CFO) - Capex
owner’s earnings = if u buy a company u can take this free cash flow home , hence they become your earnings
Accrual accounting: money is expected to be received in the future
Cash accounting: money is received instantly
Net income can be manipulated but free cash flow can’t be
Hence analysing free cashflow is very important
Cash flow from Investing activities - earnings or expenditures from non core activities like rent from long-term assets, such as buildings/equipment 
Cash flow from financing activities - cash flows between a company and its owners/shareholders and creditors from activities such as issuing bonds, retiring bonds, selling stock or buying back stock.
Cash flow from Operating activities(CFO) - earnings from core/daily activities of a company involved in producing and selling its product, generating revenues, manufacturing, sales, advertising, and marketing activities
Company is called Cash machine  if free cash flow  = 20% of sales
**If free cash flow is high => assets increases => equity increases and ROE decreases
Hence companies either use it in Capex(capacity increase),R&D(tech companies), mergers(to acquire market share/expansion)
If a company has more cash in ideal mode then it might take wrong decision and everything gets screwed.
Hence they give it as dividend or buyback shares from open market then cash decreases and the ROE is less
Generally FMCG gives dividend and tech companies won’t rather they invest in R&D to keep ahead of competition.
**CAGR - compounded annual growth rate -  on an average return rate per year
For e.g: 2015 - investment year, 9% is CAGR which means from 2015 to 2016 there is 9% profit, and whole amount(principal + profit) is reinvested and then again 9% profit on the amount and so on
**Beta analysis
Beta - A positive beta value indicates that stocks generally move in the same direction with that of the market and the vice versa
For example, if beta is 1.3 and the market is expected to move up by 10%, then the stock should move up by 13% (1.3 x 10).


//if looking for dividend:
dividend payout > 40% - good | industry leaders do that
dividend payout ratio is the ratio of the total amount of dividends paid out to shareholders relative to the net income of the company
Dividend yield > bank interest rates (6%)
dividend_amount=face value*
Dividend yield  = dividend_amount/share_price * 100


//Reading Income statement
Check consolidated values (subsidiaries included) Not standalone values
Sales/revenue/turnover/topline
COGS - cost of goods sold (preparation/making price)
Gross Profit = sales- COGS
Gross profit Margin/Gross Margin = (gross Profit/sales) *100
Operating expenses = salaries+building rent +advertising+marketing cost+ cash burn to beat the price war+ R&D cost 
EBITDA=Gross Profit -Operating expenses
depreciation expenses = capital goods(like electronics/machinery/buildings) value depreciates over time and is included in income statement over say 5-10 yrs
Amortisation expenses = same as depreciation but amortisation is for intangible assets like patents
Operating Profit /Operating income(EBIT)
=Gross Profit - Operating expenses - Depreciation - Amortisation expenses
=EBITDA - Depreciation - Amortisation expenses
Operating Profit margin/Operating Margin =(operating profit/sales) *100
Operating profit margin shouldn’t be negative 100%/200%  and keeping it steady is difficult
PBT = Operating Profit /Operating income(EBIT) - interest payment on debt 
PAT/Net Income/Net Profit/BottomLine/Earnings = PBT - tax
ICR(interest coverage ratio) = EBITDA/Interest = will the company be able to pay interest on debt. ICR should always be high so that during recession company can interest on its debt without loosing assets.
ICR is not applicable for companies with 0 debt.


//TWO VALUATION MODELS:
1)Absolute valuation: find the intrinsic value of company by focusing on things as dividends, cash flow, and the growth rate for a single company, and not worry about any other companies.
Valuation models in this category : dividend discount model, discounted cash flow model, residual income model, and asset-based model.

**Discounted cash flow model - PV of growing perpetuity
Fair value= Free cash flows/(rate-growth)
Rate = minimum expected return rate per year by the company for infinite period (WACC is generally used)
WACC is the minimum required return for a firm (expected equity returns by shareholder is roughly 14% + debt cost is the interest rate at which company took the loan)
companies always target to earn more returns than WACC
go through EY, BCG,Chief Economic Advisor reports on sector growth. expected sector growth should be >= WACC
Benchmark rates: 
low risk = 6%(govt 10 yr bond yield)
Medium	risk = 15%(Nifty)
High risk= > 20%(individual stocks/sectors/MFs etc) 
PS: since we invest in great companies , risk factor is low and hence we need to discount based on risk free rate
Add 50% or margin of safety to Fair value, i.e we pay 50% of fair value or below to buy a company
**But why is margin of safety is needed?
DCF requires making many assumptions. The future cash flow assumption might go wrong as it rely on a variety of factors, 
such as market demand, the status of the economy, technology, competition, and unforeseen threats or opportunities
Growth = by what % does free cash flow grow every year (assumption is 5%)
Why 5% - since we invest in great businesses, over long period they might have become big and the only for them to grow is when economy grows
i.e Economy growth will become company growth
Economy growth = global nominal growth/ India’s nominal growth = 5%
e.g:
Free Cash flow =10lakhs
rate=0.07 (risk free rate)
growth=0.05
Fair value=10/0.07-0.05 =10/0.02= 5 cr
So we need buy this company for  < 50% of 5 cr == < 2.5 cr

2)Relative valuation: 
compare financial ratios and EV/EBITDA with other companies in the SAME industry also of same size to know the actual value/performance compared to peers 
P/E of similar companies (ICICI, HDFC but don’t compare ICICI with Dena bcoz of diff in scale, area of operation, products ,management etc )

PS: unfortunately all valuation methods yield different values. Moreover different sectors need dfifferent kinds of valuation
like e-commerece mostly based on sales, FMCG, consulting based on free cash flows,  new companies based on P/B,
capex intensive companies based on EBITDA

E.g of Real world scenario:
Historical cash flow growth: CAGR of free cashflows for last 10yrs (take avg of  3yrs cash flows incase of heavy fluctuations)
Industry reports:  As u cannot rely on historical data always read EY, BCG,Chief Economic Advisor reports on specific sectors/industry growth and consider the weighted avg growth
of all sectors in which company has revenue from 
ITC business revenue share:
65% tobacco - tobacco estimated to grow at 6%
35% FMCG - 20% estimated growth
Overall weighted growth = 0.65*6+0.35*20=11
Assuming company grows 8% for next 5yrs and then slow down to 5% for rest of the time
Calculation of PV:
Then say in the year 2020 cashflow value is x
Till 2025 cashflow = previous year cash flow*1.11
Till 2030 cashflow=previous year cash flow*1.08
From 2031 cashflow increases @5%
In the year 2030 total cash flows = 2029 cashflow*1.08 + PV of future cashflows from 2030(growing perpetuity formula)
Calculate PV value of total 2030 cashflows using PV formula
Discounted value = 50% of PV value of total 2030 cashflows 
Market Cap should be less than discounted value to go for a buy

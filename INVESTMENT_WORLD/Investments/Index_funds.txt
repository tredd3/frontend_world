***** Index funds (passive) ****** 
What does INDEX actually reflect? 
Short Term: reflects stock market performance. P/E dominates in the period
Long term : reflects economy performance 
Index only grows when economy is doing better, consumption increase, GDP grows => implies next generation is leading a better life. Earnings dominate in this period

NIFTY 50 - top 50 companies are decided only based on market cap and not on any other factors
SENSEX 30 - top 30 companies only by market cap

Index funds - mutual funds which invest money in all the companies in NIFTY in the same ratio as that of NIFTY composition
When any company’s market cap decreases then NSE automatically adjusts the weight and Index funds would replicated the same.
If a company performance is worse then NSE removes it from the index and index funds does the same.

Does NIFTY represents GDP?
Yes. aggregate of Sales of all companies in NIFTY have a strong correlation with India’s GDP
To prove it we need to compare NIFTY sales with GDP and not NIFTY Earnings.
Because GDP is all about sales, and not all the revenue from sales will be earnings of the company because they might have to repay the debt, invest in R&D, merger and acquisition, capex for expanding etc
What if non-listed startups like paytm, zomato, ola,uber contribute more to GDP.
Will NIFTY and GDP correlation be broken? Ideally yes but if startups like these perform, then the promoters generally will list the company via an IPO to book profits. So ultimately they will become part of NIFTY index.

Dow theory: 
3 market Trends
1)Primary Trend:
Up trend: upcoming bottoms(lows) are higher than previous bottoms
Down trend: upcoming tops(highs) are lower than previous highs
2)Secondary Trend:top to low wave 
3)Tertiary Trend: can be ignored

**When to buy: 
if both PE and earnings are low no need to check dow theory
Else Let the market fall and whenever there is a recovery check
if price is more than recent significant top, check PE and take decision, earnings not required
Bank PE =100/5 = 20 , low PE range = bank PE+5
Check PE, if<25 invest 100%,  > 32 0%, 25-32 then 50% and rest in debt funds bcoz u r not sure 
whether markets will go up or down. if markets go down invest remaining 50%
Avg Earnings growth rate: 14% (avg  nominal gdp growth in longterm)
EGR < 14% for past 3-5  years buy else sell

**When to sell: 
if both PE and earnings are high no need to check dow theory
Else Let the market rise and whenever it falls check
if price is less than recent significant bottom, check PE and take decision, earnings not required
Check PE, if>32 sell 100%,  < 25 don’t sell it’s time to buy, 25-32 sell 50% 

rules to identify significant bottom (valley)
A - recent significant top
B - least point after A
C - highest point after B
Width 31 days and height change 4%
rules to identify significant top (mountain)
A - recent significant bottom
B - highest point after A
C - lowest point after B
Width 31 days and  height change 4%
If any given bottom or top doesn’t satisfy this criteria we consider them teritary waves and ignore them


//INDEX INVESTMENT - SAFEST
Stock market going down and down? Invest in Junior Nifty as well but not much, only your risk capital 
1)How to know markets are cheap?
Extremely cheap:
Both Market cap/GDP < 1 and GDP are low, both PE and EPS is low 
Estimated PE:  avg of medium range
Bank PE =100/6 = 18  low PE range = bank PE+5 , low: 23, medium : 23-28, high > 28
Medium costly: 
Either Market cap/GDP < 1 or GDP is low, Either PE or EGR is less
Generally if P/E ratio is more markets are costly but if earnings are less PE will be more and markets are still cheap because
 earnings are less. Hence market_cap/GDP is the right measure.
In the long run market cap/gdp correlation has to be 1 (bcoz company valuation depends on its earnings in the long run)

The balance sheet is a snapshot, representing the state of a company's finances (what it owns and owes) as of the date of publication.

what idea does balance sheet give us?
solvency: ability to clear debt
liquidity: can it meet short term expenses
asset heavy business ?

why is it called a balance sheet?
any change in assets/liabilities will cause a corresponding change in equity 


**ASSETS: how the company is utilising the money
1)current assets - can be liquidated within a year
current assets=cash and cash equivalents(short-term investments like T-bills, CDs)+ accounts recievable +inventory
working assets/current assets cycle:
cash used to buy inventory => inventory gets converted to accounts recievables => accounts recievables get converted to cash => repeat
cash pile is due to 3 reasons:
-by issuing bonds, equities or taking loan
-by sell exisiting business or companies assets 
-by business operations : free cashflow generated by the company
-investment operations - dividend and interest recieved
2)non-current assets = goodwill + plant and machinery + intangible assets + longterm investments
'Net Block' - the original cost of acquisition of tangible assets(property,plants,equipments) - depreciation
Note: current market value of tangible assets might be less/ more
ong term investments: investment in stocks,bonds of other companies or subsidaries and real estate 
the value in balance sheet is the value at which the company has bought the assets and not the current market value.
i.e the company might be holding businesses with DCA whose market value is much more than the value shown
**Total Assets = current assets + non-current assets


**LIABILITIES: source of funds, i.e from where does the company get money from
1)Current liabilities: to be paid within 1 year
Current liabilities = short-term debt + accounts payable + payroll + taxes + dividends
2)Non-current liabilities: to be paid for a period > 1 year
Non-current liabilities = long term debt + TDS for dividends declared
Other liabilities  -
 Provisions - set aside some amount for unseen future expenses
**Total Liabilities = Current liabilities + Non-current liabilities


**SHAREHOLDER EQUITY
assets - liabilities = shareholder's equity
shareholder's equity = common + preferred + treasury stocks + additional paid in capital + retained earnings
both common and preferred stocks value in balance sheet is par/face value
Additional paid-in capital or capital surplus represents the amount shareholders have invested in excess of the "common stock" 
or "preferred stock" par value during ipo time or QIP time
Note: these values are not market values, rather the values at which the investors hace acquired stocks in the past
Retained earnings are the net earnings a company either reinvests in the business or use to pay off debt or dividends to shareholders
or capex/expansion or buyback of shares or acquistion 
Treasury stock is the stock a company has repurchased. It can be sold at a later date to raise cash or reserved to repel a hostile takeover.

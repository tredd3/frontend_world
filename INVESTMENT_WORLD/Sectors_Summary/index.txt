//when to invest in which sector
Recession: economy growth is slow and showing some signs of recovery
Cyclicals - commodities, Auto, Luuxry goods demand goes down and hence when economy recovers the earnings recover and stock price 
   will also recover 

low inflation : 
Commodities - Metals like Gold 

Inflation beneficiaries:
1)Banks: assets gets repriced as the interest rate hikes are immediately passed on for liabilities the pass on is bit slow, High CASA ratio banks will benefit a lot , also new corporate loans addition due to more working capital requirements.
2)Insurance :  float that is invested in FD earn higher interest rates
3)B2C companies with high market share and pricing power - beacuse when inflation decreases earnings go up because the demand is 
  back and the companies that have taken price hike will maintain them and stock price goes up
4)Commodities like oil, gas and metals will benefit due to increast prices - if there is a sign that inflation increases 
 commodities provide hedge against inflation where cas  loses its value
5)export oriented, IT and pharma who get revenue in dollars will benefit bcoz of natural hedge to inflation

Resistant to inflation :
services - adani ports, CRISIL

Affected due to inflation:
Companies that require high capital will have the share beaten down because cost of capital increases
High debt levels - bcoz of high interest rate
High Capex - price of capital goods increases
No pricing power


Low interest rates: 
High dividend yield companies like FMCG, Utilities -  but if there is a transition to high interest rates then better to shift to FDs
Banks and NBFCs - because their NIM will be good when interest rates increase


Infra companies - private preferred bcoz govt can give the servcies for free to private people to boost business

B2B - govt companies preferred - like mines where there is a entry barrier and since commodities are mined pricing is decided globally 
  and demnad fron privte players is a must because these are esentialls and govt minining companies are mostly low cost producers

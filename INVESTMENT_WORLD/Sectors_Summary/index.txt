//when to invest in which sector
Recession: economy growth is slow and showing some signs of recovery
Cyclicals - commodities, Auto, Luuxry goods demand goes down and hence when economy recovers the earnings recover and stock price 
   will also recover 

high inflation: hold stocks that are beaten down beacuse of inflation bcoz when situation becomes normal they ROAR
FMCG - beacuse when inflation decreases earnings go up and stock price goes up

low inflation : 
Commodities - Metals like Gold - if there is a sign that inflation increases commodities provide hedge against inflation where cash
   loses its value

Low interest rates: 
High dividend yield companies like FMCG, Utilities -  but if there is a transition to high interest rates then better to shift to FDs
Banks and NBFCs - because their NIM will be good when interest rates increase


Infra companies - private preferred bcoz govt can give the servcies for free to private people to boost business

B2B - govt companies preferred - like mines where there is a entry barrier and since commodities are mined pricing is decided globally 
  and demnad fron privte players is a must because these are esentialls and govt minining companies are mostly low cost producers

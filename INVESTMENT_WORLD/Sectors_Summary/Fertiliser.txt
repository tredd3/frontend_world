------------------------------- Economics -----------------------------
No pricing power; From selling prices to input materials, the government has a say in everything
fertiliser industry has a seasonal nature - good monsoon means more revenue for fertiliser producers

//Input cost drivers: 
raw material cost
Natural gas


//Competettion:


/Types of fertilisers
1)Urea fertilisers are the most used fertiliser and account for 55 per cent of all fertilisers produced in India
Hence it is most regulated and govt fixes the prices
subsidies producers receive to accommodate the discount are not tied to the cost of production
but subsidies are not fixed and depends on the energy efficiency levels
meaning companies have to frequently upgrade their plants
2)P&K (phosphorus and potassium) fertiliser
The government fixes the subsidies rather than the prices
meaning P&K fertiliser companies receive the same amount as subsidies regardless of the cost of production.
As a result, these companies have to be at the top of their capital efficiency game to stay afloat
ROCE, OPM are most important things


-------------------------------- Stats -------------------------------
India is a fertiliser deficit country, meaning excess fertilisers produced by a company would never go to waste
most of the demand is catered by exports bcoz there is no local manufacturing


------------------------------- Risk -----------------------------
subject to heavy regulations
subsidies are rarely provided on time. - increasing the recievable days and need to take short term loan

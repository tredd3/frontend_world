--Industry: Banking(still india has a scope for penetration)
Backbone of an economy
cyclical - but behaves like hybrid of cyclical and defensive
Banking business depends on 3 things : MANAGEMENT, MANAGEMENT and MANAGEMENT
Main business: Borrowing and lending
Other services: invoice discounting, insurance, MF sale, escrow accounts, 
Revenue model = net interest income(main business) + non-interest income (other services)
low cost of borrowing - bcoz they are regulated by RBI and backed by Govt
Balance sheet scrutiny is very important
A mortgage is usually a loan sanctioned against an immovable asset like a house or a commercial property. The lender keeps the 
 asset as collateral until the borrower repays the total loan amount. 
Banks losses must be covered by earnings , if not reserves , if losses > (earnings + reserves), they end up eating equity
Bank Financials doesn't tell much about the Financial health of bank, u need to look at annual report


Look for:
Asset quality(low NPAs) and how much does a bank earn on those assets (ROA) compared to peers
product/services portfolio depth and reach to public
Geograpical spread - good to have both urban and rural,i.e as deep and wide as possible to reduce risk
savings and other low cost deposits trend
CAR = (tier 1 capital + tier 2 capital)/Risk weighted assets - CAR determines the bank's capacity to meet the time liabilities and 
other risks such as credit risk, operational risk etc - RBI monitors CAR to protect depositors, thereby maintaining confidence in the banking system
 tier 1 capital - which can absorb losses without a bank being required to cease trading
 tier 2 capital - which can absorb losses in the event of a winding-up 
loan diversification (to multiple sectors/industries/companies) - avoid banks where most loans are in riskier sectors
loan/assets mix - high % of Retail loans is preferred compared to corporate loans bcoz of low probability of default
Note: Banks with high % mix of corporate loans may grow aggresively (faster) but when recession starts /some unfortunate event starts
  these banks will be work hit. Hence business/financials of corporates to which bank lend is also imp to consider
Quality mix of corporate loan book - infra/construction/energy sector has defaulted traditionally
Prudent recovery and collection procedures
low NPAs(for loans),charge-off rates(for credit cards) and delinquency rates(late payments) compared to peers
*delinquency rates are imp bcoz they can turn in to a NPA
*charge-off rate is a measure that shows the percentage of defaulted credit card balances in comparison to the total amount of credit outstanding
good provisioning wrt to NPAs
In this industry growth cannot be significantly faster than peers(if yes then it can lead to troubles , hence deep scrutiny is needed)
Must be Complient with Basel norms (for both liquidity and risk frameworks)
good banks make sure that the duration of long term liabilities is same as that of long term loans

//Best time to Invest
1)Interest rates are currently lowest and about to increase - i.e high inflation scenario
Note: In this scenario prefer the one with High % of floating rate loans - bcoz interest rates linked to repo rates and get 
 reflected immediately and liaibilities cost takes time to increases
2)Credit growth/Private capex cycle is reviving

Financials:
Should have strong Capital base compared to peers(check balance sheet)
operating costs should be less
Segment wise revenue: core income should contribute more at any given point 
 i.e non-interest expense should less as a % of revenue
ROE and ROA must be high (provided provisions ~= GNPA )
CASA,NIM -Â must be more
higher CASA indicates current and saving account deposits are more compared to time deposits => low cost funds for banks =>high NIM
NPA - must be less
Good if Non interest income continously growing(extra income for bank) But this should complement interest income and not replace it
P/B between 2-3 is a good bet to buy strong banks


Moats:
Entry Barriers (difficult for new player to enter or the existing player to became No.1)
Brand(for attracting deposits and talent)
Size (Large banks have prudent risk management framework and access to Capital markets)
Economies of Scale(take advantage of larger distribution network)
Switching costs


Risk:
increase in NPAs during recession
not globally competetive

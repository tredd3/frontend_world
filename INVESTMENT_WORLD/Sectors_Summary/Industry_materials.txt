industry materials
--type1: commodities sector
categories: Metals(Gold, silver, Steel,copper), Energy(Crude oil, Natural gas, Gasoline), Chemicals, Agri products, Sugar,Paper,
Raw materials,now a days mobiles have also become commodities
Business model: take raw materials => produce inputs and machinery => other firms will use it
no pricing power - globally decided
also buyers will choose based on price else commodities are the same product regardless of who makes them
high fixed costs and have many hard assets(buildings,machinery,equipment)
MOATS: 
hgh entry barriers but low margins bcoz of zero pricing power
low cost provider(with high sales volumes and low debt)
high market share(but not at the cost of profitability of the firm)
concentrated industries, where few players capture entire market share (like defense,nuclear) - where customer have no switching option
Niche/differentiated products (like speciality chemicals)
having/building products that cater to various industries
FINANCIALS:
low debt (as this is a cyclical sector, during economic downturn firms can see huge losses if they have more debt)
Asset turn over should be high compared to peers, especially FATO-fixed asset turnover(sales/fixed_assets) as firms are mostly 
depend on factories, large/heavy equipments to generate revenue
CCC: inventory days and recievables days should be consistently low
dividend paying stocks reward shareholders for holding stocks even during economy downturn
generally these kind of firms have high operating leverage bcoz of fixed costs, but extremely high operating leverage => high debt
during economy downturn to service fixed costs => share price take a hit as the earnings are used to repay loans/interests
Red flags:
D/E > 0.5, most important factor to look at as it can make the firm bankrupt
chasing market share : market share increase is not an indicator of efficiency unless FATO,TATO improves and hence companies 
should focus on profitability and not market share
more acquistions : intergration charges will be high and dilution of shares
Risk:
cyclical - high volatility 
firms generally ntake debt to cover up the fixed costs during recession => interests eating up your profits
if imports are cheaper then the frims get affected as well
Always invest in bear markets and never in bull markets as the money might get stuck in for years

--type2: value-added goods/services
Value added goods: electrical equipment, auto parts, speciality chemicals and heavy machinery(long business cycles)
wide moats for: auto parts, speciality chemicals bcoz of patents and niche products
Moat:
Those who spend on technology not only for developing a product but also for improving manufacturing efficiency, cutting production costs
R&D spending - for product innovation / product differentiation

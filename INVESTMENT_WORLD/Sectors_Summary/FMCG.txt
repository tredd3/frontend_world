4)FMCG - defensive - saviour in bear markets
business modal: company - retailers/wholsellers/distributors - customers
typically moves wrt to GDP and sometimes even slower than GDP - Hence they can ONLY be profitable in long term
Demand is almost static and hence profits are dependent on inflation
generally available at high valuations(bcoz of brand power and strong financials)
so while using DCF make sure cashflow rate is acc to gdp rate if not slightly higher

//Indian FMCG Stats
percapita consumption of FMCG goods in india - 45$
china - 3X, indonesia - 2X
Meaning india has a huge headroom for growth and in india particularly it is not a zero sum game
meaning increase in one FMCG company sales will lead to decrease in others

//highly mature companies so very less growth strategies:(generally a mix of strategies is used)
-innovation:launch new products and capture market share (but new products has to click)
even when new prodcuts becomes popular still the revenue growth will be in single digit
R&D is important bcoz differentiated products boosts ur pricing power
-acquistion:acquire others business and grow(its better to acquire businesses in the same industry so that existing infrastructure can help )
also it depends on which company u have acquired and what price
-operating cost reduction
whatever the strategy you follow revenues can't grow above GDP, so company must focus on cost cutting like occasional restructuring
look for consistent low operating expenses and high OPM wrt peers
Note:cost cutting shouldn't happen in ads, bcoz brand may disappear from people's mind
-sell products overseas
there are countries which are in a growth spree and selling products in that area leads to double digit growth
e.g: cococola has a single digit growth in US but in abroad it has double digit growth

Economic Moats:
large market share
economies of scale(sell low cost product by spreading expenses on volumes)
brand recognition by customers + market share
strong distribution network(dedicated distributers even make it better)

Look out for:
*cash machines - check how company is utilising cash (look at dividend payout ratio and consistency in payout, buybacks etc)
*are they building brand? - look at sales in comparison with ad spending, if the company is not spending on ads inspite of lesser sales
then the company might be focused on earnings and not on brand building (company should promote the brand but not products with low prices)
*innovation - is the company coming up with new flavor of exisiting product or completely innovative products
new flavor products is preferred by companies bcoz consumers are aware of the brand 
but for a completely innovative product to click it has to educate the customers, spend on ads and it has to have unique features and
substantial advantage over its substitutes(look out for companies that has launched new prodcuts successfully over the years)
*company has to cut costs but the growth shouldn't depend on cost cutting alone. It has to be accompained with sales growth 
bcoz cost cutting can happen to a certain extent after which it is difficult to cut costs

Risks:
inflation of raw materials
because of fierce competettion the margins are generally less at around 20%
margins depend on middle class purchasing power
pricing power is questionable because middlemen like walmart and amazon have a huge customer attraction and can decide pricing

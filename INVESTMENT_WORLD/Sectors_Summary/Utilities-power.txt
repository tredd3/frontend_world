Utilities - highly regulated sector with commodity type behaviour
Industry: electricity, water, gas
highly regulated sector with constant demand hence it fetches guaranteed but low fixed income(i.e steady cashflows)
highly competetive(low margins) - commodity industry(no pricing power bcoz govt decides whether the increased fuel and operating 
  prices needs to be passed on to customer or not) - high fixed costs(high debt will ve a problem)

/Indian stats
Total Installed Power Generation Capacity in India 393 GW as of Dec'21:
Coal+Lignite - 210, 53%
Renewables(sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat) - 105, 27% (solar 49GW)
  solar (49GW) is about 47% of the renewable capacity
  The target for Solar has since been raised to installing 300 GW by 2030.
Hydro(waterflow from dam/river rotates turbine of generator) - 47, 12%
Nuclear - 7, 2%
Diesel - 1, 0.1%
Gas - 25, 6%


------------- Electricity - generation, tranmission and distribution -----------
/Generation - input:coal/gas/uranium/sunlight/wind/water output:electricity, deregulated, low entry barriers, low margins because
 of competettion and high operating leverage(high fixed costs, only fuel is the variable cost)
/Transmission - trasporatation of electricity from generation plants to grids via wires, regulated, high entry barriers, even though
 they operate as monopolies, still have low margins bcoz of rates regualtion
Note: wireless transmission is a game changer in this industry but is difficult to acheieve as well but not impossible
/Distribution - transmit power from grids to homes/businesses , wide moats bcoz of monopolies but low margins bcoz of regualtion
interms of wide Moats distribution > transmission > generation
Summary: low margins either because of regualtion or competettion


Regulations:
state govt regulates structure,costs,competettion of the companies => regulation means low and steady margins
environmental agency regulates the amount of emission by power plants(mainly for coal/thermal plants) - companies must spend on
expensive upgrades to reduce emissions
nuclear agency regulates the nuclear power plants
Note: Regulated companies are safe heavens, deregulation is positive interms of pricing power but negative interms of competetion 
considering its a commodity industry with low entry barriers


Financials:
even though financial are positive they are very less making it less attractive for investors
Don't invest assuming that steady cash flow yields dividends bcoz most companies have high debt
high debt for most companies => all the steady cashflows are used in interest payment
if dividend yield is ridiculosly high => stock price is falling and company is in trouble
Look at the price to book value if the company is trading below its assets value


Look for :
companies with low debt, stablitiy in financials, operating in stable regulatory environments(i.e having monopoly/less competetion)
companies that stay focused on its core business rather than entering in to other ventures that are out of its expertise, bcoz
 this can lead to bankruptcy.
If the company has heavy debts then it should be a long term, debt check annual report footnotes - Also company should make enough
 operating profits to service the interest
Especially if u r buy Utility company for dividends make sure to check their debt position and their payout ratio and 
dividend paying history for last 10 yrs
If a utility company is owned and controlled by Govt then generating ROIC > WACC if near to impossible(no indian company has done 
it so far). However if the sector is privatised then we can think of owning it like Berkshire Energy
Power plants geographical location, condition and stability is very important - look at the accidents that happened and how the 
  company handled it or bounced back from situation
Cost of 1 unit of electricity/1l of gas compared to peers - low is preferred
Increasing capcity to cater to high demand is always positive - so expanding capex is good in the long run

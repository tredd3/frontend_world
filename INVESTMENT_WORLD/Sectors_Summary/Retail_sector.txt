Consumer services
highly competetive sector - no pricing power hence thin margins
low or no barriers to entry
outperform during periods of economic strength and underperform during econoimic weakness
industries: Restaurants(QSR,FSR), retailers(like Walmart, Dmart, clothing,footwear, Grocery store, Furniture)
with both parents working QSR is increasingly becoming popular
look for companies that provide quality, quick and low cost services
Retailers with CCC -ve , i.e with less inventory and more payable days are bound to be strong
recievable days are negligible for retailers as they collect cash from customers immediately
speciality retaiers like Nike, Puma ,Decatholon have MOATS for short term
Note: In retail it is not about total sales or total stores it is all about having best per store sales/profit


//Types of store ownership model
1)COCO - company owned company operated
company opens stores in new places and operates the existing ones to maintain brand value among
 customers. However this model is difficult to scale bcoz it is capex heavy , company has to 
 spend its own money to maintain the store
E.g: Dmart, Metro footware 
2)FOFO - Franchisee owned Franchisee operated
Franchiser own the store, operating expenses by franchisee owner
Merchandise and price is decided by the company
Franchiser needs to pay certain amount of revenue as Royalty to parent company
This is the best model to scale the business but any bad maintenance or experience will dilute 
  the brand value in customers mind
Hence companies take atmost care in setting up store infra, equipments, staff training etc
E.g: MCD, APOLLO DIAGNOSTICS
3)Distributor model - give all products to distributors and they give it to various retailers
4)E-commerce : Amazon, flipkart, NYKAA fashion stores own sites for businesses


//Types of outlets
EBO - exclusive brand outlet - JOCKEY, ZARA, CLEVIN KELVIN stores
 only one brand products are sold
MBO - multiple brand outlet - Reliance , Pantaloons, Shopers stop
 multiple brand products are sold
Large format stores(LFS) - huge size 
E.g: Walmart, Dmart, Lifestyle


Growth oppurtunities check:
same store sales growth and per store profitability
operating profit/net profit per Square feet area is also important for comparison between peers
if a store is successful in one area you can open a store in other areas and make it successful - are they doing it?
Franchisee model is the best compared to company owned - because company is expanding its brand and opening new stores and that 
   too with someone else's money. It gets 5-10% of sales as Royalty fees
Most of the retailers have a mix of both these models - prefer the one which has more Franchisee models
Keep an eye on expenses: especially rents/leases (if u open store in malls then the rent is higher) - any retailer which has lot of 
 stores in malls/expensive locations like airport etc should generate very high sales/profits compared to stores in non-prime
 locations
increasing store efficiency (reducing expenses per store) - one time 
need to have USP/Differentiation: like recycling used shopping bags from customers, collecting used bottles/clothes inexchange
 for money to customers etc - these small things generally act as an attraction to customers (but ofcourse customers have to love 
 the products offered by the company and these things are additional )


Moat: 
low cost supplier(economies of scale)
quality and comfort for public(clothing and footwear)
constant innovation and products inline with the trend
per store efficiency

Risk:
avoid those retailers that expand too quickly that too using debt - more than 50-100 outlets a year is a problem
 bcoz if you expand too fast you may pick wrong places, wrong managers, pay more for real estate etc rather they should expand 
 slowly every year and that too using cash from operations (this ensures sustainability)
opening more stores with poor per store profit of existing stores is a bad sign
changing consumer trends and firms need to match up to that else they will go bankrupt - true for fashion retailers
Inventory management - huge inventory might lead to offer sale and slash prices 
COCO model - They need to keep expanding , so focus on lease and depreciation expenses

Note:
stock might have gone 20X/30X times - but if there is enough room for the stores to grow in the country then the stock can 
 still go to 30X/50X from now - bcoz stock always possible the earnings of business

Consumer services
highly competetive sector - no pricing power hence thin margins
low or no barriers to entry
outperform during periods of economic strength and underperform during econoimic weakness
industries: Restaurants(QSR,FSR), retailers(like Walmart, Dmart, clothing,footwear, Grocery store, Furniture)
with both parents working QSR is increasingly becoming popular
look for companies that provide quality, quick and low cost services
Retailers with CCC -ve , i.e with less inventory and more payable days are bound to be strong
recievable days are negligible for retailers as they collect cash from customers immediately
speciality retaiers like Nike, Puma ,Decatholon have MOATS for short term

Growth oppurtunities check:
same store sales growth
if a store is successful in one area you can open a store in other areas and make it successful - are they doing it?
Franchisee model is the best compared to company owned - because company is expanding its brand and opening new stores and that 
   too with someone else's money. It gets 5-10% of sales as Royalty fees
Most of the retailers have a mix of both these models - prefer the one which has more Franchisee models
Keep an eye on expenses: especially rents/leases (if u open store in malls then the rent is higher) - any retailer which has lot of 
 stores in malls/expensive locations like airport etc should generate very high sales/profits compared to stores in non-prime
 locations
increasing store efficiency (reducing expenses per store) - one time 
need to have USP/Differentiation: like recycling used shopping bags from customers, collecting used bottles/clothes inexchange
 for money to customers etc - these small things generally act as an attraction to customers (but ofcourse customers have to love 
 the products offered by the company and these things are additional )


Moat: 
low cost supplier(economies of scale)
quality and comfort for public(clothing and footwear)
constant innovation and products inline with the trend

Risk:
avoid those retailers that expand too quickly that too using debt
changing consumer trends and firms need to match up to that - hence companies with more inventory can lose their value
most consumer services concepts fail in the long run, so if u made investment in a speculative growth stage of a company
 then u need to continously monitor
financials might be inflated bcoz lease amount is not recorded on the balance sheet

Note:
stock might have gone 20X/30X times - but if there is enough room for the stores to grow in the country then the stock can 
 still go to 30X/50X from now - bcoz stock always possible the earnings of business

--Industry: Insurance (mostly avoid but if there is an exceptional company u can consider holding it)
Types: life, general/non-life(health, vehicle, travel, home, fire , crop, marine), reinsurance(transfer risk of premium payment)
stakeholders: insurance products, retail policy holders, corporate policy holders, IRDAI,TPAs(third party agents who does claims 
verfication), re-insurers, distribution network(banks , agents etc),hospitals, AMC(where insurance companies does investment),
 brokers and web aggregators(policy bazaar)
private insurance players are gaining dominance
TPAs like mediassist are the most profitable business model in insurance sector (but the risk is if in house settlement 
 increases, no pricing power as insurance companies decide them, technology disruption can happen) - so take more margin of safety
price de-tarrification is done by IRDAI and now price is decided by competettion

//Life Insurance
India is under protected and not under penetrated - because of mix of investment + insurance
reinsurance companies are globally diversified(GIC, SWISS RE)
products based on customer needs:
1)savings: linked(ULIP, linked to stock markets), non-linked(participating(like bonus, mobeyback), non-participating(guaranteed return))
participating - participating in the returns which insurer has invested in (usually in bonds)
2)protection: term plan, life, health, disability etc


//why Life insurance sector?
as it is a must for everyone
india's penetration being extremely low

//business terminology
high margin: individual insurance > group insurance
high margin business : term plans/protection > non participating > participating > ULIP
non participating - investors/share holders are most benefitted
participating - customers are most benefitted
Linked: payout Linked to financial markets


//accounting terminology
persistency ratio : higher persistency means certainity of profts is high(i.e premiums are being paid out by insurance holders)
complaint ratio: low is preferred, if it is higher surrender rates will be higher and persistency will be less
solvency ratio: higher it is more guaranteed that insurer is gonna pay claims, min is 150% as set by IRDAI
cost ratio: less is better (operating expenses + commission expenses)/premium
expenses are incurred and not amorotised over years, but profits are realized over years 
//An insurance company’s valuation is determined by the embedded value (EV)
The ‘embedded value’, in short, is the sum of the present value of future profits from all policies + the market value of net worth.
claim settlement ratio: no of claims settled/Total no of claims
claim intimation ratio: claim amount settled/Total claim amount
//annualised premium equivalent (APE) growth is like sales growth for Insurance companies
APE is the sum of the regular annualized premium from the new business plus 10% of the first single premium in a given period.
//VNB is like EPS for insurance companies
 value of new business (VNB), which is the present value of profit that is expected to be generated over all future years by 
 the new business written in a particular year.

High Capex 
input cost drivers: raw materials(natural resources like limestone), power and fuel, manufacturing and freight
high fixed costs(raw material cost + fuel cost + employee cost etc) to produce cement, therefore volume growth is critical
Cyclical and can be debt heavy
monsoon quarter has low sales 
Demand drivers: real estate, infra, commercial and industrial development
per capita consumption:  210kg
avg per capita consumption in a developing country: 510 kg (huge growth oppyrtunity)
commodity industry with pricing discipline
very less pricing power for even top players bcoz of dynamic pricing, i.e price is decided by demand and supply - Risk
low margins for infra suppliers and relatively High margins for retail suppliers, also low margins bcoz of high tax
The Indian cement industry has to be viewed on a regional basis viz, North/South/West/East. Demand may be favourable/unfavourable in some areas.
It is also highly fragmented(no company has a power to control the industry )with top six companies already accounting for 60% of
  industry capacity, the rest 40% is distributed among 40 small players


Look for :
that reduce manufacturing cost by automating the plants,
reduce freight cost by strategically situating manufacturing plants near port or railway and also at different locations in india
 instead of only in one state
reduce power cost (by using solar and green energy)
raw material cost (difficult to control but backward integration or doing something here works)


Risk:
any material change in raw material prices or contracts with suppliers can hamper production to a huge extent. 
companies need to make huge bids for mining rights of limestone(look at balance sheet)

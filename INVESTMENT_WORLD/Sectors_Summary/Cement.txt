//About
cement chemical composition - limestone, clay, iron oxide, silica sand
alternatives to limestone like flyash, slag are used to produce blended cement at lesser prices
flyash - by product of burning coal in power plants
slag - by product of iron blast furnace
High fixed cost  
Cyclical and can be debt heavy
monsoon quarter has low sales 
Demand drivers: real estate, infra, commercial and industrial development
commodity industry with pricing discipline but no customer stickiness as price decides the decision
low margins for infra suppliers and relatively High margins for retail suppliers
The Indian cement industry has to be viewed on a regional basis viz, North/South/West/East. 
It is also highly fragmented(no company has a power to control the industry) 


//Input cost drivers: 
  power and fuel (mostly coal) - 25% of expenses
  freight - 25% of expenses
  raw materials(natural resources like ) - 25% of expenses
  manufacturing - wet process (fuel inefficient), dry process (fuel efficient)


//Competettion:
imports - ZERO competettion from imports bcoz there is a huge capacity in india itself and freight costs make it unviable for foreign players
threat of new entrants(almost ZERO) - mining rights of limestone has to be alloted by the Govt
existing competettion : 
  unorganised - 40%
  consolidation is happening bcoz of weak balance sheets of competettiors

-------------------------------- Stats -------------------------------
India is world's 2nd largest producer and consumer of cement after China
per capita consumption:  210kg
avg per capita consumption in a developing country: 510 kg (huge growth oppyrtunity)
Total capacity - 530 million tonnes (utilisation is 63%)
south has highest (bcoz of limestone availability)
top 6 companies accounts for 60% of industry capacity, the rest 40% is distributed among 40 small players
 6 companies - ultra tech (114 tonnes), shree (46), ambuja(31), acc(34),  dalmia (35)


------------------------------- Risk -----------------------------
any material change in raw material prices or contracts with suppliers can hamper production to a huge extent. 
companies need to make huge bids for mining rights of limestone(look at balance sheet)
very less pricing power for even top players bcoz of dynamic pricing, i.e price is decided by demand and supply
  however carteliation is done in cement business, which is a collection of independent businesses or organizations that 
  collude in order to manipulate the price of a product or service.


------------------------------- what to look for -----------------------------
low power cost (by long term contracts, captive power consumption)
low freight cost by strategically situating manufacturing plants near port or railway and also at different locations in india
 instead of only in one state
low raw material cost (difficult to control but backward integration or doing something here works)
reduce manufacturing cost and increase efficiency of plants by automating them


------------------------------- Company picks and Reasons -----------------------------
Shree cements:
 lowest cost per tonne
 use of split grinding units
 80% power is captive power consumption
 85% customers within 200km range - low freight cost

Ultra tech:
  highest cost per tonne
  present everywhere in india

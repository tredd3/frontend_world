/ENA is the primary raw material for making alcoholic beverages and it is derived from different 
sources - sugarcane molasses and grains. It is widely used in the production of alcoholic 
beverages such as whisky, vodka, gin, cane, liqueurs, and alcoholic fruit beverages.
/Extra-Neutral Alcohol (ENA) is an ethanol grade of 96% purity or higher. It's main use is as the base ingredient in the production
 of alcoholic spirits.
/molasses : viscous, dark and sugar-rich by-product obtained during sugar extraction from the sugarcane
/Like ethanol, ENA is also a byproduct of the sugar industry and is formed from molasses, resulting from refining sugarcane or 
  sugar beets into sugar.

//Process
All spirits go through at least two procedures - fermentation and distillation. 
Fermentation is where all alcohol is created (yeast or bacteria breaks down the sugar content in a substance in to alcohol + some by product)
distillation is where the alcohol is separated and removed by boiling and then condensation


//ETHANOL Production
For the production of ethanol, ethanol factories in India employ the following types of raw materials:
  1G - Based on sugar and molasses.
  2G - Materials of the second generation (biomass, mixed grain, and agricultural waste and Grain-based).

//Ethanol stats
Uttar Pradesh has emerged as the country's leading producer of ethanol, and 54 distilleries spread around the state generate a 
 total of 58 crore litres of ethanol.
US and Brazil produce 84 per cent of all ethanol production in the world
In US ethanol is made from corn.

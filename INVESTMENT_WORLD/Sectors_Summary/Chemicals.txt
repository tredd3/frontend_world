use of chemicals: almost everwhere
Cyclical
Based on raw material prices which inturn is dependent on crude oil prices
Global competettion (mainly fron China) - but now china+1 is an emrging trend
After Russian-Ukraine war, India becomes a destination for chemicals as Germany which is the largest supplier of chemicals will 
  take a hit due to crude oil prices.
Threat of product replacements (by a better alternative product)
4 trillion USD is the Global chemical industry size - india contributes only 4%
import 56 billion USD, export 41 billion USD
1 trillion - specality,  3 trillion - bulk chemicals
Tailwinds:
  blue sky - pollution control of current chemical companies
  Europe gas crisis - Russia Ukrain war
  COVID - supply chain deconcentration

//Types of chemicals listed in increasing order of value addition
petrochemicals - commodity
basic chemicals - anyone can manufacture
specality chemicals- only few can do it - expected CAGR 12% for next 5yrs 
  50% of specality chemicals - agro chemicals, dyes and pigments
performance chemicals 

//chemical products
Deepak nitrite - solvents (import oppurtunity), downstream products, entry to flourine space, backward integration(cost advantage),
    debt free, new capex using reserves, ROCE > 30% on incremental capital
F&F + Nutra - high entry barriers, product specalisation, end market growth potential - speific to customer
 privi
personal care - high entry barriers, product specalisation, end market growth potential
dyes and pigments - low entry barriers - low capex, very polluting industry - chinese competettion is high
cleaner and greener chemistry:
  clean science
  flouro chemicals - navin flourine, srf, gujarat flouro chem
  tatva chintan
EV:
 neogen - lithium chemicals - EV batteries
 tatva chintan - electrolyte salts(but only small part of their portfolio)

//Investment framework
1)safety and compliance: most important
  plant accidents
  pollution control board
  affluent treatment plant/zero discharge - must have
  USFDA audit(warning letter import alert)
2)product portfolio
  leadership
  innovation - either in product/process
  differentiation of product
  diversification of product portfolio
  end user industries: pharma and personal care (high margins)
3)execution capabilities
4)ability to scale

//Risk:
plant fires
pollution
hazardous environment
products harmful to environment
waste management

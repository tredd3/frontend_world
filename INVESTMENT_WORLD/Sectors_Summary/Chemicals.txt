------------------------------- Economics -----------------------------
//About
use of chemicals: almost everwhere
Cyclical
Types of chemicals listed in increasing order of value addition:
  petrochemicals - commodity
  basic chemicals - anyone can manufacture
  specality chemicals- only few can do it - expected CAGR 12% for next 5yrs 
    50% of specality chemicals - agro chemicals, dyes and pigments
  performance chemicals 

//Input cost drivers: 
Energy intensive - need to run power plants
Based on raw material prices which are mostly produced from natural gas - like Ammonia is used almost everywhere 
  to produce other chemicals
Threat of product replacements (by a better alternative product)

//Competettion:
Global competettion (mainly fron China) - but now china+1 is an emrging trend as companies want to deconcentrate their supply
    chain and operation blue sky (pollution control of current chemical companies)
After Russian-Ukraine war, India becomes a destination for chemicals as Germany which is the largest supplier of chemicals will 
  take a hit due to crude oil prices.


-------------------------------- Stats -------------------------------
4 trillion USD is the Global chemical industry size - india contributes only 4%, China 20%
import 56 billion USD (33% China, 42% Asia other than China, Europe 11%)
export 41 billion USD (8% China, 32% Asia other than China, Europe 26%)
  India is a large exporter of organic chemicals to Europe
1 trillion - specality,  3 trillion - bulk chemicals


------------------------------- Risk -----------------------------
plant fires
pollution
products harmful to environment and human body
waste management
substitutes keep coming every now and then 

------------------------------- what to look for -----------------------------
1)safety and compliance: most important
  plant accidents
  pollution control board
  affluent treatment plant/zero discharge - must have
  USFDA audit(warning letter import alert)
2)product portfolio
  leadership
  innovation - either in product/process
  differentiation of product
  diversification of product portfolio
  end user industries: pharma and personal care (high margins)
3)execution capabilities
4)ability to scale


------------------------------- Company picks and Reasons -----------------------------
Deepak nitrite - solvents (import oppurtunity), downstream products, entry to flourine space, backward integration(cost advantage),
    debt free, new capex using reserves, ROCE > 30% on incremental capital
F&F + Nutra - high entry barriers, product specalisation, end market growth potential - speific to customer
 privi
personal care - high entry barriers, product specalisation, end market growth potential
dyes and pigments - low entry barriers - low capex, very polluting industry - chinese competettion is high
cleaner and greener chemistry:
  clean science
  flouro chemicals - navin flourine, srf, gujarat flouro chem
  tatva chintan
EV:
 neogen - lithium chemicals - EV batteries
 tatva chintan - electrolyte salts(but only small part of their portfolio)

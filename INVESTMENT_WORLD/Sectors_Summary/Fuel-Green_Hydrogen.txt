//5 processes to separate hydrogen (NOT Green Hydrogen)
1)Natural gas reforming : Most Used
  convert gas to steam at high temp to separate components and H2 is separated
  cheapest way
  95% of world produces it this way
  -ve: pollution is produced also better to use Nat gas directly
2)Renewable liquid reforming :
  Ethanol to steam at high temp
  very costly
  -ve: better to use ethanol directly
3)Fermentation
using sugar cane biomass - time taking and expensive
not viable
4)Gasification
Coal/biomass convert to steam and oxygen at high temp 
-ve: produces CO2
5)Electrolysis: Most Cleaner
electricty(generated from Renewable energy) -> water -> H2(Green hydrogen) + O2 (Oxygen)
problem: high cost, can't be performed in salt water (it has to be purified before processing other wise chroline gas 
  is also produced and most importantly Anide and Cathode will disfunction)
NOTE: This is the only greenest way of producing Hydrogen 

//Transportaion : either Liquified or Gas
but as H2 in gaseous form is very reactive, we transfer it via pipes 
liquid form needs converting gas -> liquid and viceversa needing high energy

//Companies trying to capture this Space
1)Reliance
2)Adani
3)L&T Power Limited
4)NTPC
5)GAIL
6)Cummins -  produces electrolysers used by Gail and transportaion containers
7)KPIT - Hydrogen Fuel Technology
8)GFL - solutions for entire value chain
9)HPCL, BPCL, IOCL, ONGC 
10)DE Nora - produces anodes & cathodes used in electrolysers

Photovoltaic panels include one or more PV modules assembled as a pre-wired, field-installable unit.
Solar/PV modules are made up of smaller units called solar cells
Solar cell is made from silicon (second most abundant element on earth)
Light/photons that falls on solar/silicon cells eject the electrons, they travel and go back to where they have left
Each solar cell can give u half a volt
Solar Glass is the protector of solar panels


//Cell efficiency is very important
If the cell  doesn’t absorb sunlight and reflects it then energy is gone
If the electron fallback to a hole before going through the circuit 
Most efficient cell can only convert 46% of photons to electriity
Most commercial systems are only 15-20% efficient  
on extremely hot or cold days when the system DC voltage may exceed the inverter's permissible input voltage range, hence effective solar inverters should also be in the market


//Indian market
1)strong government support for Indian solar manufacturing Industry
  Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme hiked to Rs. 24,000 Cr. Budget 2022 for domestic solar cell and module manufacturing up 
    from Rs. 4,500 Cr announced earlier. 
  Imposition of BasicCustoms Duty (BCD) on solar cells (25%) and modules (40%) effective from April 1, 2022
  CVD on imported solar glass from malaysia
2)The target for Solar has since been raised to installing 300 GW by 2030 (from 50GW in 2021)
incentive for farmers to install Solar Pumps/Grid Connected Projects etc - 110 GW by 2030
20 GW of Land Capacity to be installed by 2030 for self sustenance
Emergence of Electrical Vehicles along with viable battery storage expected to lead to considerable increase in demand
3)module manufacturers/ developers among others who announced investments in additional/new module manufacturing capacities

/Cyclicals are best bought during recession(lower inflation levels) - when stock price hits the rock bottom
/Commodity prices are globally decided based on the demand and supply which is linked to economic booms and burst, geopolitics, 
  interest rates etc
  Their prices are traded every day in the commodities market.
  demand from developing nations such as China and India—whose economies are still growing—is also pushing up prices.
/high PE means cyclicals earnings have gone down and they are ready to rise - good time to consider buying/accumulating
However like anyother investing having knowledge in that particular industry gives u an edge
/Any cyclical company with a good balance sheet will rebound (check DEBT - CASH position compared to equity)
/Also check the capex amount compared to the cash flow generated

Energy - most countries including india heavily relies on imports

Industry: Crude oil, Natural gas, Coal, Green Hydrogen
2/3 of world's energy needs are met by oil and gas
huge fixed asset costs - cyclical sector
large part of oil and gas reserves are present in middle east, hence the countries exporting oil/gas formed a group called OPEC
OPEC artificaially inflates the prices by co-ordinating and limiting supply, hence mainpulating the prices for the whole industry benefit
Reason for OPEC power: non-OPEC reserves are less and depelete faster compared to OPEC countries
no pricing power bcoz price is globally decided => biggest influencers of financial health
high fixed costs(cost of taking oil from ground to refinery is fixed irrespective of oil price) + high price volatility => AVG/NO profits for many years
Business model: upstream(exploration and drilling/extraction) => Downstream(pipelines/ships to carry to off shore refineries => service stations)
few oil companies own certain parts in the chain whereas most of the companies own the entire value chain(called integrated oil companies)
OPEC has made Upstream business more profitable than Downstream(as upstream companies will only drill when prices are high)
Industry: products/services to oil companies - drilling services,
oil companies have high profitability primarily because of OPEC support which maintains the oil prices so that oil companies 
are always profitable, but the oil services industry is highly competettive and no protectors, hence weak margins and low profitability
Reason: when oil prices are high companies use these services to quickly take final product to market to reap the profits else 
they don't want to extract the oil and wait for the prices to be normal which is not in their hands


//India Stats
overall crude oil imports of 175.900 MMT(million metric tonnes) - overall requirement for india 0.4 billion cubic metres per year
In FY21, India imported 85% of its crude-oil requirements and 50% of gas requirements
India’s major sources of crude oil and gas imports are Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE, Nigeria, Kuwait, Oman, and the US. 
India imported share - middle east 60%, Russia 20%, north america, south america & Africa 20%
Furthermore, there is an ongoing expansion of imported RLNG handling capacity in India, which is expected to augment the 
 availability of natural gas in the future - Majority of the industrial and commercial users are envisaged
 to shift to natural gas from alternative fuels due to ease in usage and favourable regulatory push.
estimated natural-gas reserves are around 1,141.3 billion cubic metres(ONGC, the country’s largest oil and gas company, produces around 22 billion cubic metres every year)
Around 198 discoveries of oil and gas have been notified in the basin so far. Of this, ONGC has 156 discoveries, RIL 31, Vedanta eight, and OIL has three discoveries.


MOATS:
oil company in countries part of OPEC
large company size and customer base
for commodity industry - economies of scale Moat is a must(especially in the Downstream by spreading the costs to large customer base)
upstream is dependent on geology and geography of company's reserves - difficult to keep cost down here but if a company does that it will have an excellent moat
high ROIC and profits compared to peers

Look For:
Integrated oil companies with good financial track record in both boom and burst years OR companies who only does upstream operations
e.g: IOL(integrated company), ONGC and Oil India (only upstream companies)
high fixed costs and cyclical sector hence D/E < 1 is preferred to sail through burst years
oil reserves growth or capacity wrt peers(future profit for the firms)
reserve replacement ratio > 1 , i.e company has found more than what it is extracting => reserves are increasing
if it is < 1 then company has to spend on exploration or acquistions
good dividends/effective utilisation of cash flows - as the energy sector is mature , most of the companies generate high cash flows 

Risks:
as oil and gas are commodities, OPEC is the protector but if any company comes out of OPEC and sells at will then it is a problem
Russia is the one which has largest reserves outside of OPEC countries - can be a competettion by selling at low prices and 
capturing the market share but russia economy is coupled with oil industry fortunes hence low cost selling is difficult
Clean and Cheaper energy development - Solar, wind and other forms
Note: even though these risks exists for last 20-30 yrs still oil companies have delivered excellent returns to their shareholders

//Sectors directly affected due to crude oil
paints - use 60% raw materials
cement and steel - freight and power costs are 30% of overall costs
transportation - direct affect
Airlines - 35% cost is derived from crude and crude derivatives
FMCG - packaging costs increase
tyre and rubber - chemicals used are derived from crude oil
chemical industry - where crude derivates form a major part of chemicals
Auto sector - people won't buy individual vehicles and prefer shared transport

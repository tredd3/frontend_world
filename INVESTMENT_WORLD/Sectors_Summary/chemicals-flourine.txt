Flourine Industry:
//Flourine:
Highly reactive, forms stable compounds
Small in size & less in weight
Availability: 12th most abundant element on earth
//Usage Industries:
1)Fluor specialty used in Agro, Pharma, Industrial, and other uses. High Margins
2)Fluoropolymers - Commodity-grade and value-added. Commoditized + High Margins in VAP
3)Inorganic Fluorides - Used in the steel and glass industry. Low Margins
4)Industrial chemicals like Chloromethane.
5)Pharma Propellent - Used in Metered Dose Inhalers as a propellant. Only SRF can make this.
6)CRAMS for Pharma - Navin is doing. High Margins

//Fluorinated organic compounds in   Agro chemical/Pharma:
22% of the drugs approved by the FDA in the last two decades contain at least one fluorine atom, on average
53% of pesticides introduced during 1998-2020 contain the fluorine atom.

//Flouro polymers in Electronics/Automobile: for insulation and coatings
Why flouro polymers?
Heat resistance, durability, and high strength are key properties to use the product in fire safety equipment in automobiles and aircraft.

//Supply
Commodity Fluoropolymers are dominated by China and Value-added ones are with Western companies.
Market Share:
SRF - 36%
GFL - 34%
Navin - 20%
Others - 10%
1)Navin:
Navin Fluorine does contract manufacturing for Pharma innovators and has many biotechs as its clients
Intermediate+API
Decades of experience in flourine chemistry
Working on HPP(high performance product) Intermediates and HPP has water applications, this Opens up Fluoropolymers space for Navin Fluorine.
Working on a compound that can replace Lithium.
Electronic chemical applications focused on India market are likely emerging opportunities from FY25 onward - battery solutions, semiconductors, and solar industries.
Navin Fluorine's customers include premium A/C manufacturers such as LG, Samsung, Voltas and from other industries like Reliance, Piramal, Godrej etc.
Focus markets - India, Middle east
Focus Areas:  producing fluoro-based intermediates / APIs for Agri / pharma applications
Huge Capex for all the above - funded via debt

2)SRF: SRF has created a significantly diversified business model with a focus on Ref Gas and fluoro-based intermediates /APIs along with packaging and technical textiles.
Proxy play on agrochem intermediates

3)GFL:
Europe and US are key markets for GFL
85% value added products where Chinese presence is limited
India’s only Fluoropolymer producer and among the top few globally - Backward integration into all the major fluoropolymers
full vertical integration right from natural minerals to value-added Fluoropolymers, and strong R&D have been the cornerstones of our success.
Fluoropolymers Cater to all new age verticals like EV, Hydrogen Fuel Cells, semiconductors, 5G etc.
Fluoropolymers are the most convenient and superior material to manufacture green technology applications, from wind turbines to photovoltaic panels.
Flourspar mine in Morocco  -  raw material for Fluoropolymer mined in house
Post FY25, the company anticipates significant CAPEX allocation to for battery chemicals and backward integration of essential chemicals.
New variant of Ref-gas being produced
integrated battery chemicals complex at Dahej - for the production of LiPF6, the most popular electrolyte salt for lithium-ion batteries.
The company’s focus will remain on business expansion only in fluoropolymers and battery chemicals in the medium term, and it does not expect any incremental investment in the fluoro specialty business (intermediate for agro / pharma products)
Risk: future growth depends heavily on battery chemicals post FY25


//Entry Barriers
Flourine chemistry has become complex, only few have the capability to handle it

//Bricks OR ACC blocks
AAC block bricks are more stable against earthquake forces in comparison to clay brick structures. 
Brick construction is time-consuming due to smaller bricks and more joints. AAC blocks achieve speedy construction due to their 
bigger size, low weight, and fewer joints.
AAC blocks provide excellent thermal and acoustic insulation, as well as Termites, rodents, and fungal growth are all prevented 
 by the lack of cavities. It does not rust the way metal does.
The blocks handle fire better than traditional blocks. These blocks are up to 3 times lighter in weight than traditional clay or cement blocks.
It will not burn or emit hazardous fumes because it is non-combustible
AAC also reduces air conditioning bills due to its excellent thermal insulation property.
Aerocon AAC blocks :
  reduces the amount of steel and cement utilized while lowering the project's cost by 30%
  innovative manufacturing technology and skills enable building enterprises to increase development time by 30%.
  The AAC blocks help to cut power consumption by about 27%.
  It is made entirely of recycled materials, producing no waste 

materials used to build AAC block in India: Quartz sand, Cement, Fly Ash, Calcined gypsum, Limestone, Water and Aluminum Powder.

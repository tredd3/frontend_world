-------- why to buy and hold? Business Strengths ---------
high growth potential: only 6% of marriages in India are from online match making (estimated to grow by atleast 5 times)
tech driven platform with servies and operations migrated to cloud (AWS)
24*7 customer service support to find a relevant match


//Growth oppurtunities
continue to look for opportunity beyond India - srilanka, bangladesh etc (here Competettion is very less)
marriage servies currently contribute to 1% of revenues. But going forward it has a huge scope with ShaadiSaga integration as 
  it is has significant presence in both North and west markets. Matrimony has very good reach in south india hence leading to 
  synergy in operations making Matrimony  single largest player in the wedding services space.
Joodi - matchmaking service for less privileged people (in nascent stages need to monitor)


//Moats
asset light buiness model with very high operating levarage and economies of scale
  Fixed cost: employee cost + rental cost (hence huge operating leverage as any increase in the customer billings will fall
   straight to bottom line). Negligible variable cost
End to end player which means all the successfull customers who found their match can be converted to customers of 
 marriage services(which means vendors show more interest and ready to pay more for listing)
only profit making company in matrimony space


--------- why you shouldn't hold the company? Business Weakness ----------
Not a repeat business as in Any individual would only need this service once in his lifetime


//Competettion
North markets - Shaadi and Jeevansathi (matrimony is trying to invest in marketting and coming up with new product 
   offerings to stay competettive)


//Risks
keep an eye on ad/marketting spends - if it is significantly high then better not to buy
 compare marketting spends with sales and profit.As of nov 2021 marketting spending = 4*net profit

US stocks to invest: My picks
1)Global Monopolies
2)High growth businesses
3)stay away from dividend stocks because of high tax rate

** Investing in US stocks or ETFs by Indian investors is permissible under the RBI’s Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS)
1)Tax:
--Taxes on investment gains: You will be taxed in India for this gain
STCG: Less than 24 months, Income tax slab rate (+ surcharge and cess)
LTCG: More than 24 months @ 20% + indexation benefit (same as debt funds in india)
--Taxes on dividends: Unlike investment gains, dividends will be taxed in the US at a flat rate of 25%.
For e.g: if Microsoft gives an investor $100 of dividend, it will withhold $25 as tax, and will give the investor 
the post tax dividend of $75. Subsequently, this post tax dividend is included as taxable income in India (as normal income).
Fortunately, US and India have a Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA), which allows taxpayers to offset income tax already
 paid in the US. The 25% tax you already paid in the US is made available as Foreign Tax Credit and can be used to offset your 
 income tax payable in India.
2)you are allowed to invest up to US $250,000 per year per person (roughly 2cr)
Once the remittance amount exceeds 5 lakh rupees per person per year u need to submit form 15CA
3)Convert INR to USD - GST of 0.18% is charged 
i.e 180rs for every 1lakh deposited
4)USD to INR - $11 withdrawal in vested
in Ind Money if the withdrawl amount exceeds $2000 it is free
Note: Both Vested and Ind money are investment advisory firms, hence they never keep ur cash/Stocks with them
Its either the broker that keeps both the USD cash and the securities.
5)What if he runs with the money/goes bankrupt? - Insurance covers for us
we are Insured up to $250k(cash) and up to $250k(securities), i.e total $500k under SIPC Act
6)Buy fractional shares unlike india 
Note: But keep more money in India as india's growth will be much higher, however Global monopolies and growth companies 
 can give you significant returns over longterm


//Reasons for investing in US/Global markets
1)Most of the Global monopolies are in the US and one of the best growing companies are in China
2)US is the biggest economy with 21 trillion$ GDP and china is second biggest which has the potential to become 1st
3)Rupee depreciation that will happen for India to grow , will put more return on top of the actual returns
4)correlation: hardly there is any correlation between US, China and Indian Stock markets
5)Diversification

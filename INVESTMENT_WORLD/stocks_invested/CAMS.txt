Moats:
Switching costs: RTA business is sticky, if a mutual fund is being serviced by a particular RTA shifting to another RTA is difficult 
 as huge amount of data and information needs to be transferred and there is a high risk of disruption of operations and customer experience
Entry barriers: because of switching costs, also MF RTA business is technology intensive requiring continuous upgradation of 
 systems and processes in line with the increase in volumes and changing regulations, Investments in technology and branch expansion
 is justified only if volumes are adequate, hence a new players has to think twice before entering this space


Risk:
Revenues are dependent on AAUM of mutual funds, if AAUM managed were to decline due to tough market conditions, revenues of CAMS will be impacted
Top 5 clients contributed to 68% of revenues in FY20. Client concentration risk is high, even if 1 client were to move to another player, revenues will be impacted
Regulations impacting mutual funds will impact the RTAs. For instance the latest regulation of capping expense ratios for AMCs will impact RTAs
Company handles confidential data – personal and financial information of clients. Any breach of their systems will create legal and regulatory risk

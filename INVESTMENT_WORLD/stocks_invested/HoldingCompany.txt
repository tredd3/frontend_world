2 types of holding companies:
1)pure holding:
no business, but is a shareholder of so many child companies
Look for :
what all companies did the HL(holding company) invest in and their future scope
how are child companies performing and their financials
very imp: hat does HL do with the dividend recieved? reinvest in new business/increase stake/pay dividends to 
 HL(holding company) shareholders/transfer to related party
over diversification ?


2)non pure
has its own business + shareholder of child companies as well 
e.g  HDFC(holding company), children(HDFC Bank, HDFC Life, HDFC AMC etc)
Look for :
how is the standalone business doing and long term scope 
financials like any other company
Look for section of pure holding company

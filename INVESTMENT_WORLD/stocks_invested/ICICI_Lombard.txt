pricing risk via data driven methology and not any random method based on competettion
consevative management
consevative portfolio(80% in bonds) even in debt where they invest only in quality + equity + cash for claims
no bond default in history - because they don't look only at credit rartings, rather look at management,future scope and strength of business
health insurance share is very less: even in that it is exposed more to retail(benefits plan , where they cater to only specific 
 ailments/diseases) they also have indeminity plans where everything is covered in hospital care but it is very less
pandemic situations Risk management: SAHI companies have a problem in pandemic situations where risk is concentrated, but in 
ICICI high claims in  health insurance is nullified by low claims in auto sector


Risk:
in auto sector, insurance sales still happen via car dealers, this takes time to change
in health lot of relationship and advisory is needed currently

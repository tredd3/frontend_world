------------------- SCREENING SUMMARY -------------------
//General check:
  stock picking strategy: suggestion from youtuber
  Normal check on stock price since inception - sudden increase in price bcoz of sudden increase in earnings
  legal orders(confirm from wiki) and tickertape - None
  check shareholding pattern(especially promoter) trend over the years in tijori
    Promoter holding : 40%
    Institutional ownership: 40%
    others: 20%
  promoter pledging - None
  Is the business easy to understand or complex : easy
  circle of competence: Yes
  any recent insider buying (bse india > disclosures > insider trading) : 512 (2021), 922(2022) price
  any bulk or block deals (to discover price? Not recently

//Business check:
  //how is the quality of product/service - Good and famous
  CRISIL Rating must be Above A and check Rating History for last 3 Years - A1+
  can a fool run this business - yes
  can you put 50% of your net worth, buy the whole business and forget about it for next 5-10 yrs ???
   assuming that stock market is closed for next 5-10yrs are you ok holding the entire business without knowing its price every year?
  for longterm : don't invest in a stock just bcoz the stock price will increase, invest because you want to own that business

//Finance check:
1)Balance sheet Strength check
--Equity/Total assets (liabilities should be as less as possible for a strong balance sheet)
--(Price to book value) - 5 (not an asset play)

//non-current assets - <value>
-if Goodwill is more on the assets side but the acquired companies are not able to generate profits then Book value significantly 
  decreases because people won't buy the company or value the company for the price at which u have bought
-intangible assets that help u in creating some value or they themselves have some value that others are willing to pay is fine else
  they also can loose value like crazy
-long term investments (won't lose value but depends on the investment if it is a business and doing bad it might lose value) -
  u need to check notes to consolidated financial statements

//Net current assets -<value>
-cash , land and  financial investments won't lose value - indicating that the balance sheet is strong
-inventory as % of total assets - can quickly lose value depending on the type of inventory like fashion will quickly lose it,
  but raw materials will not 
--check current assets(mainly cash) compared to current liabilities - bcoz if current liabilities > current assets then u need to 
  sell non current-assets to clear them or take loan (both are bad)

//shareholder Equity -<value>
--Check Equity CAGR from balance sheet equity section 
   if it is constant then check dividend section in cashflow analysis bcoz company might be giving out its earnings as dividend OR 
     (check share capital section where company might be doing buyback)
   if it is decreasing then it MUST be only from buybacks (if not company is doing something wrong it is losing/selling its assets)
   if equity is increasing check ROE trend
--Sorce of Equity increase: to find this out balance sheet should be studied in tally with cash flow statement
 Sustainable:  cash flow from operations(goes in to retained earnings) 
 Non-sustainable(one-off): cash from from investments(goes in to retained earnings) and financing activities(goes into share 
  capital, u need to check EPS trend)

//non-current Liabilities - <value>


2)Profit and loss statement
--sales growth consistent and increasing?
--operating profit +ve  most of the time and growing?
--earnings quality check : core business vs other income contribution to profits over the years?
--interest expense >40-50% of operating profit?
--net income consistently +ve and growing? 
  
3)Cashflow statement
--operating cash flow must be atleast 70-80% of  operating profit 
--CFO +ve most of the time and growing?
--free cash flow consistently +ve and growing?
Note: if free cash flow is -ve check why
free cash flow -ve bcoz of operating cash flow => company is bad and in-efficienct
free cash flow -ve bcoz of capex => is it doing continous capex(10 yr check cash flow analysis)
--use of cash flow from operations: check 10yr cash flow analysis in tijori (preferrence is reinvestment)
//check cashflow from financing section
-- if debt is increasing u need to check the usage of debt in investment section or is to cover Operating loses?
-- if equity is increasing?  (if yes EPS should also increase)

4)Profitability Ratios Check:
--GPM(consistent and above 15%) trend - company has Pricing power 
--OPM(consistent and above 15%) trend - company has Efficient management 
--NPM(consistent and above 15%) trend - good profitability
Note: if NPM is less then check Asset turnover ratio, if both are less than ROE is less and you need to avoid that business
--ROE consistent and  10-15% (with D/E under control)? ROE is the real return as this indicates that owners wealth is being compounded 
--ROCE(consistent and above 15%) trend - return on capital is good than cost of capital
--ROIC(consistent and above 15%) trend- company is generating enough cash in its core business
--check D/E trend ?
if D/E > 0 check in the balance sheet if the long term debt is increasing ?
can long term debt can be cleared by earnings of 4 yrs?(look at debt/Profit metrics in screener)

//Valuation check
Price is different Valuation is different, just bcoz stock is falling doesn't mean it is cheap(earnings might be falling too)
Price - is what people pay for the business
Valuation is price compared to earnings 
Note: Don't invest in a stock because the price has fallen and you think the price will increase , own the stock because you 
 understand that business(circle of competence) , believe in its future(i.e predictability and earning power) and it 
 is available at lower valuations (absolute(DCF) and relative, with more focus on absolute)
--EV/FCF(Market cap + debt - cash&cash equivalents)/Free cash flow Valuation: 100
--PEG: 1.82
--DCF: 15% CAGR returns if Radico profits grow at 15% CAGR

--------------------------- BUSINESS STRENGTH CHECK ---------------------------
Investor presentation for reference: 
1)PAST :
quick check
know about the company:
  Nature of business: consumer goods(veblen goods)
     limited edition - hence they are expensive - ironically demand also increases with price
  what does it do (Product/Services Portfolio/business verticals): 
    Radico Khaitan is one of the largest and oldest manufacturer of IMFL(Indian Made Foreign Liquor). 
    Company has wide range of branded portfolio across IMFL categories of Whisky, Brandy, Rum and White spirits. 
  How does it do it:
  Raw materials : molasses, glass and packaging materials
  Rampur plant : grain , molasses ENA, malt spirit
    100% self sufficient on its power requirements => effluents(liquid discharge) => biogas => power
    conversion of Rampur existing 140 KLPD molasses plant into dual feed (extract ENA/Extra-Neutral Alcohol(ethanol of 96% purity
       from both molasses and grains - broken rice, wheat, maize)
    grain ENA production at the Rampur campus will increase from 100 KLPD to ~260 KLPD
    malt maturation => to be used in niche premium brands
  Sitapur campus: grain based distillery (to reduce external dependence on raw materials)
    100% self sufficient on its power requirements using bio fuels from the inception
     production of up to 400 KL per day distillery with integrated facilities to manufacture extra neutral alcohol (ENA),
       country liquor (CL), IMFL and ethanol.
    Bottling capacity of 10 million cases each of IMFL and Country Liquor to be set up in phased manner
    Malt maturation hall keeping in view the future growth potential of Rampur Indian Single Malt
    Given the ample land, this campus will have a scope to double its capacity in the future, including additional malt 
    distillation and craft gin plant
  Subsidaries/JVs:

In the business for 7 decades
why did the promoters start the business: to capture the huge oppurtunity insome industry/sector OR passion
any research report/youtube analysis available for the company: 
what peter lynch bucket does stock belongs to : stalwarts/fast growers


2)PRESENT :
---Sectoral analysis:
licensing rule and complicated tax structure makes the external environment more challenging for the existing and new players.
alcohol per capita consumption : 5.9 litres per litres per year
EUROPE: 12 L
US: 9L
China: 7.5L

Whisky consumption is 75% of the total consumption
consolidation of industry - 15 players remaining
difficult to build economies of scale as prices varies bcoz of tax rate change according to states
7 states - pricing power
2 states - banned
12 states - state govt controls the pricing
5 states - need to negotiate 
//STAGE of development:
pioneering - EV, green energy
growth - internet
maturity/saturation - FMCG
declining - obselete - TV channels, print media
//Sector value chain : from sourcing to sales entire process and businesses involved must be known (you should always pick companies 
at profitable end of value chain), demand and supply (size of opportunity)

---Products/services DEMAND check :
//From where does the demand come? 
//Type of demand
//Market size/Oppurtunity: huge

---Products/services SUPPLY check :
//product portfolio :
milloniare brands - 8 PM Whisky, Contessa Rum, Old Admiral Brandy and Magic Moments Vodka
regular - 
prestige and above - premium
The Company launched 12 new brands over the past decade. Of these new brands, 11 brands are in the premium category.

//Is there any peer whose market share is higher than the current company? 
POSITION IN PEERS :

//COMPETETION :

//how do peers provide competetion :

--- Products/services Uniqueness check :
what makes the product or service of this company Unique?


3)FUTURE :
---Process/Strategy check?
--- Sustainabile Growth of Earnings check (Moats and Growth oppurtunities)
1)Competettive advantage/MOAT Check?
Economises of Scale - N
Low cost producer - N
Brand
Taste
Entry barriers - difficult to get license from state govt, no alcohol drink advertising allowed, 
Luxury/Premium Range

2)PRICING POWER (MUST HAVE MOAT)
very high - people don't mind spendinging as alcohol is either consumed in group or in parties
but since the industry is higly regulated

3)EARNING POWER 
//SOURCE OF EARNINGS
--Internal Growth oppurtunities
CSD canteen demand - no foreign liquor allowed, hence this a strongest MOAT
export growth oppurtunities - exports to 85 countries
focus on high margin/premium products
--External Growth oppurtunities
Macroeconomic
Tailwinds

----Capital Allocation 
//SOURCE OF CAPITAL - Debt/Retained Earnings/New Equity
EPS = Net Income(earnings)/Total Shares outstanding
1)RETAINED EARNINGS(cheapest and most preferred) - i.e reinvest free cashflow generated by the company
+ve scenario: Earnings increase => EPS increases => share price increases
-ve scenario: you will lose Reserves, but your Earnings will remain same => EPS remains same => share price remains constant
most importantly it doesn't have to pay any interest , also the total number of shares outstanding doesn't change
Hence a company needs to do some experimentation with the products/geography or try something new it is preferred to use 
RETAINED EARNINGS by generating more operating cash
2)DEBT(next preference)
+ve scenario: Earnings increase => debt repaid => after repayment whatever company acquired using debt(brand value, building, plant 
  and machinery) will remian with the company and fetch cash forever
-ve scenario: if debt levels are very high and Earnings decrease => company need to sell assets and repay debt => Bankruptcy
3)NEW EQUITY(EPS will decrease) - ESOPs, Preferential issue, QIP, Private placement etc
+ve scenario: new equity raised is used in the best way possible (reinvesting in own buiness/M&A) => Earnings increase => EPS increase
  and hence share price increases
-ve scenario: Earnings decrease and Total Shares outstanding increases, EPS drastcically goes down and hence stock will be overvalued
  taking share prices down bcoz of massive selling


---USE OF NEW/INCREMENTAL CAPITAL : A good company always uses capital for achieving operating efficiency or focus on next phase
 growth and not for survival (like expenses , capex maintenance etc) - if it uses for survival then it is capital intensive business
Cash - waiting for oppurtunities
Organic growth - putting back the money in the same business like meaningful expenses provided you maintain your return ratios(ROE/ROCE/ROIC)
Inorganic growth - M&A for strategic purpose or to build a MOAT
Dividends - most mature companies give out dividends as they don't find better oppurtunities to re-invest profits
Buyback - preferred
Capex - new
Capex - old PLANT/MACHINERY maintainance (this can't be for ever year meaning sustainence capex is bad for the company)
modernising or technology upgradation of operations
R&D - for future business but the amount spent has to be monitored
Advertising - brand building and awareness activity but the amount spent has to be monitored, along with sales growth
Working capital (tied up in) - bad
MOAT building or repairing or strengthening (so that earnings are not snatched by someone)


//RETURN ON CAPITAL
https://goodcalculators.com/wacc-calculator/
why Return on Capital is important?
Over the longterm the investment returns will always resemble the capital returns

Avg company : ROIC/ROCE ~= WACC
Good company: ROCE/ROIC(return on capital) >> WACC (cost of cpital)
either ROCE is increasing and capital is constant OR Capital is increasing and ROCE is constant
Ideal company : if it can redeploy the incremental capital for same/high returns over time - it becomes a compounding machine
i.e both ROCE and capital is increasing

// SUMMARY (Business Quality Check) - decided by PAST, PRESENT and FUTURE of the company
  -Predictable and consistent/recurring EARNINGS for next 10 yrs(MOATS, pricing power)
  -Competes on value rather than price bcoz company that competes on value is like a magnet with stronger magnetic field  that
    attracts customers and companies which compete on price will lose their business to competetiors
  -prefer non commoditized business - if commoditized the it must be a low cost producer
  -Non-cyclical :consumption has been increasing each year regardless of the business cycle.
  -lousy industry/highly competettive industry/niche industry(no big players have entered yet) ?
  -proxy play on some capital intensive/debt heavy/lousy industry ? 
  -give high allocation to recession proof stocks(like QSR) , if not how did the company perform during recession years
  -Superior economics (what does company produce, target audience and how does it produce): ESG Principles
   Environmental: does the process/products cause any kind of pollution
   Social: does the products/services add some value to customers or do they waste their time or money or destroy their health
   Governance: Superior Management and board of directors
  -Scalable business model - globally preferred (mutibagger are made because of this property)
  -Company having calibre or potential to adapt to the changing business environment - having said that invest 
    in a business with slow rate of change, rapid change is the enemy of an investor as it needs more capital to adapt and 
    burns more cash to be in the competettion)
  -Having Tailwinds is an added advantage as it boosts the process of wealth creation and helps u in achieving goal faster
  -If a person has lot of money can he break ur business and take away marketshare?
  -Ideal business always takes little amount of capital to operate and an excellent business always
    earns same high returns on incremental capital


------------------------------ FINANCIAL STRENGTH CHECK --------------------------
check Financial_Strength_Check.txt
//Financial strengths
No margin impact - due to Premiumisation and in-house ENA production
expenses - 7% of sales in brand building
//Financial weakness

------------------------------ MANAGEMENT CHECK --------------------------------

----------------------------------- RISKS ----------------------------------------
check Risk_Check.txt
---Business Risk:
1)cyclicality in raw material prices and lower than expected production can impact groiss margin
 However, the company maintains a sizable inventory of molasses which insulates it against short and medium term fluctuations in molasses prices.
2)ENA prices may also increase due its alternative uses, especially in ethanol blending and a more attractive price offered by the petrochemical industry. 
 However, the company’s capability to shift to a grain-based distillery insulates it against any significant increase in prices of 
 molasses.
 Further, RKL has flexibility to shift its production between grains and molasses with change in prices of each.
2)Liquor ban and price cap might be a risk - highly regulated industry
The liquor industry is highly regulated in India, with each state controlling the production, sales, and duty structure, independently.

---Financial Risk:
high tax rates

---Management Risk:

---Investment Returns Risk:

//Businesses 
food delivery (core)                                                           
Hyperpure is an initiative by Zomato to provide fresh, hygienic, high quality ingredients and supplies to restaurants.
  -Need for a single vendor which provides almost 100% of their basket
  -Need for transparency/ visibility of their costs, including their food yield.
  -Delivery at short notice and on-time, so that restaurants plan their operations better
Impact creation:
recycle more than 100% of all the estimated plastic packaging 
All electric fleet by 2030


//Capital requirements
no capital needed for now as it is a asset light business and all the equity investments have been made
Zomato Instant (10-minute food delivery) - capex needed to set-up the food finishing stations.


//Revenues
restaurant commission rates
ad-sales 
customer delivery charges


//costs associated
discounts
ad spending
deliver costs
operating cost


//All our investments fit into one of these two buckets
1) put the building blocks for a robust quick-commerce business in India, and 
2) accelerate digitisation and growth of the food and restaurant industry which accelerates our core food business.

//Governance
Deepender Zomato founder and CEO has 99% of his wealth in zomato and he gives more important to learning and not money
He exited investments at zero gains just bcoz Zomato considered investing and to avoid any conflict of interest
Investors: Alibaba (16%), Infoedge(18%), Uber (9%)
But MD and CEO has taken heavy ESOPs - even though the company is not on profit track


//Growth oppurtunities
Macroeconomic - achieveing scale and network effect
ad-sales
delivery cost reduction
all the foreign subsidaries will be closed except UAE


//Risks
competettion - if commission rates are increased restaurants may go to competettion
large players enetering the market - if this business is super profitable then big players will bring in the competettion by 
  pouring in lot of money, giving heavy discounts and attracting customers 
Moat(customer base and network effect) building requires to spend lot of money in the form of discounts , ads etc- paytm type scenario 
 might get repeated in the process of creating value for customers
unavailability of delivery partners in search of better jobs
ESOP heavy - can have a heavy impact on EPS

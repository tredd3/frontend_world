Overall: keep track of market share, international glass price and raw material prices
Business : just because solar power generation increases doesn't increase borosil renewables business , it's business increases 
   only if either foreign or domestic module manufacturers source glass from them

glass price last quarter: 133

Financials :
look at consolidated financial statements (european subsidary results will be included)
Track EPS growth as share count(from 130cr shares) will keep on increasing becuase of ESOP, QIP, Share swap of European subsidary
Tract Debt and interest compared to profits

------------------- SCREENING SUMMARY -------------------
Basic check:
  stock picking strategy: bottoms-up/top-down/cloning/contratian/familiar with the product or industry/profits going down due to 
     capacity to suffer/suggestion from youtuber or broker
  stock price falling continously/abnormal(google search): Yes/No
  legal orders(confirm from wiki) and tickertape
  corporate actions, dividend history and announcements from tickertape
  check shareholding pattern(especially promoter) trend over the years in tijori
  promoter pledging
  is the business easy to understand or complex :
  any recent insider buying (bse india > disclosures > insider trading) (Especially if normal employees are buying apart form 
    promoters/top management then its a positive sign as they know better than any broker/analyst/investor)

Business check:
  screener pros and cons
  market share trend
  CRISIL Rating must be Above A and check Rating History for last 3 Years(scroll down in crisil report)
  can a fool run this business
  can you put 25% of your net worth, buy the whole business and forget about it for next 5-10 yrs ???
  for longterm : don't invest in a stock just bcoz the stock price will increase, invest because you want to own that business

Finance check:
  //Balance sheet
--Total assets(current valuation) compared with Marketcap - to identify asset plays
--check current assets(mainly cash) compared to current liabilities - bcoz if current liabilities > current assets then u need to 
  sell non current-assets to clear them or take loan (both are bad)
--shareholder Equity growth should be due to retained earnings growth and not new common stock(check cashlow statement - financing 
  activity -- proceeds from shares section)
  //Profit and loss statement
--sales growth consistent and increasing?
--operating profit +ve  most of the time and growing?
--other income significant to operating profit over the years?
--interest expense >40-50% of operating profit?
--net income consistently +ve and growing? 
//Cashflow statement
--CFO +ve most of the time and growing?
--free cash flow consistently +ve and growing?
Note: if free cash flow is -ve check why
free cash flow -ve bcoz of operating cash flow => company is bad and in-efficienct
free cash flow -ve bcoz of capex => is it doing continous capex(10 yr check cash flow analysis)
--use of freecash flow: check 10yr cash flow analysis in tijori (preferrence is reinvestment)
//Ratios:
--NPM(consistent and above 10%) - company has Pricing power 
--OPM(consistent and above 10%) - company has Efficient management 
--ROE consistent and  10-15% (with D/E under control)? ROE is the real return as this indicates that owners wealth is being compounded 
--ROCE(consistent and above 15%) - good profitability
--ROIC(consistent and above 15%) - company has MOATS
--D/E < 1?
if D/E > 0 check in the balance sheet if the long term debt is increasing ?
check D/E trend
can long term debt can be cleared by earnings of 4 yrs?(look at debt/Profit metrics in screener)

--------------------------- BUSINESS STRENGTH CHECK ---------------------------
Investor presentation for reference: 
-------------------- PAST --------------------
quick check
know about the company:
  Nature of business: B2B goods (probably cyclical due to price fluctuations)
  What does it do: (what is the actual business): 
     High Performance Solar Tempered Glass - company does deal in glasses with various thickness, size and textures.  
  How does it do :
    //Raw materials - 99.5% of materials are available domestically
      soda ash
      Gas - have long-term contracts or medium-term contracts with the GAIL 
      Electricty
    //Manufacturing Processes - how ?
    Use of low cost renewable energy. Owns 1.5 MW of wind farm and is developing solar plant of 1 MW and proposed investing in 
      10 MW Wind-Solar Hybrid power plant
    The Company has a 22% lower carbon footprint in comparison to the default score for glass manufacturing in Life Cycle Assessment. 
      This value is the best value so far for glass manufacturing as per a very reputed European institute.
    Received a patent to use the waste materials as a part of raw material 
    Close loop water circuit system- For water treatment and reuse of water
    Installed sewage treatment plant
    //every month there is a price negotiation and quantity confirmation from the customers. Sometimes it is done on quarterly basis.
     solar glass after all is about 11%, 12% of the cost of PV module
  Target Audience : Solar Module and PV manufacturers globally and domestically
  Subsidaries/JVs: Interfloat Europe(100% owner)
    Interfloat has 65% market share i.e 2.5 GW (with a capacity of 500TPD)
  market size: large
  market share: 
    35% (remaining imports from Malasiya, China)
    50% (after increased capacity of 2100 TPD)
  Presence : offices in India and Europe (acquired company)
  Globally competetive company: NO
  REVENUE GEOGRAPHY: 
    Exports - 20% (relatively less profitable than domestic sales bcoz in domestic we have the CVD thing added to actual import 
     price - but still we have exports exposure because of the potential and risk management  in a way that we maintain relation 
     with big customers and service minimum quantity to them)
    domestic remaining
  Revenue Model: 
    Thinner glass (2mm, 2.5 and 2.8 mm) - 30% portfolio (prices 25% higher than conventional glasses)
  Clients(Important ones):
    domestic - 100 customers
    international - Majority international customers based in Western Europe/Turkey, which leaves scope to expand to other markets
       like US, Russia, MENA And Latin America
promoters:
why did the promoters start the business: to capture the huge oppurtunity insome industry/sector OR passion
any research report/youtube analysis available for the company: 
what peter lynch bucket does stock belongs to : slow growers/stalwarts/fast growers/cyclicals/asset heavy/turover(special situation)


--------------------- PRESENT --------------------
---Sectoral analysis:
//STAGE of development:
pioneering - green energy
//Sector value chain : 
soda ash + gas(raw materials) => manufacture solar glass from furnace => extract tempered glass from normal glass (what %of that is
 extracted measures the efficiency of the firm's manufacturing process) => manufacture solar modules => installation(power generation)
//Market size/Oppurtunity or possible demand for the Sector: it is not about how big a company is, it is about how big a company can get
   domestic and exports :
        not limited to a single user (almost every user will find its usage now or eventually)
        not limited to single business (almost every business will find its usage now or eventually)

---Products/services DEMAND check :
//From where does the actual demand from for the company? 
  B2B - from module and PV manufacturers
  Global - exports

//Type of demand
    one time demand - because replacement of a module timeline is 25yrs
    Transitionory Demand - continous and growing

//Capturing sector demand Oppurtunities:
sector demand is growing and it is the only player in india


---Products/services SUPPLY check :
1)Product portfolio :
High Performance Solar Glass for 
• solar PV
• High Performance Green House
• Solar Rooftop, Water pumps
• Solar Thermal projects
• Bifacial - using two glasses in each module front and back i.e charging from both sides as against one in the case a conventional
  module and as a result, there is a shift in favor of thinner glass of 2mm globally. 
• Borosil Solar Glass with low Antimony content
• NoSbEra: Borosil Solar Glass – without Antimony(patented technology) - Borosil is the only solar glass manufacturer in the world
 who has been able to successfully remove the Antimony(toxic element) from Solar glass
Value added products:
Recently developed a solar glass with matt finish on both sides - Transmission value reaching higher than 94% with use of an 
  appropriate AR Coating
SELENE” ANTI-GLARE SOLAR GLASS FOR PV PROJECTS NEAR AIRPORTS - Reflection/ glare from the PV modules installed near Airports may
interfere pilot or airport staff’s visibility. 

//In order to achieve the optimum module weight, the Solar PV market is moving towards use of thinner glass
World’s 1st fully tempered thinnest Solar Glass for versatility and longevity - Reduces the overall weight of the module leading to
Project Cost Optimization, Offers Superior Edge-to-Edge sealing increasing module lifetime (up to 40 years), strength & reliability.
Applications of thinner glass : Floating PV, Frameless Modules, Bifacial and  Glass-glass modules


2)COMPETETION :  none in india
  global competettion - low cost imports risk from china any Malasiya
  threat of new entrants - high entry barriers but large players can come in disrupt it though it will take some time


3)Listed peers Comparison: no peers


4)Products/services Uniqueness and Quality check :
what makes the product or service of this company Unique?
 ENGINEERED FOR LONG TERM DURABILITY, safe and strong

------------------- FUTURE -----------------
---Goal/Aim that the company wants to achieve and what is the Strategy that it wants to employ?
//Goal/Aim - global leader, capture market share from unorganised players, cleanup stuff and become efficient etc
//Strategies being employed: 
ideally a company that clones other successful strategies is almost bound to win provided it has other necessary qualifications


--- EARNING POWER (Earnings Growth Oppurtunities check )
//SOURCE OF EARNINGS
--Internal Growth oppurtunities
capex - 5 times increase by FY24 (from 450 TPD to 2100 TPD) + 500(Interfloat europe) - Total 2600 TPD (tons per day)
  mode of capex funding is debt(200cr) + equity(200cr) + reserves (200cr)
  1000TPD will cater to 6GW PV capacity
high margin product usage in future -  As of now demand in India is almost zero & all the demand from exports, but projection is that 
  30% of the overall installation in india and 40% across the globe will be bifacial going forward taking the demand for 2mm glass 
  higher (bifacial means both sides glass meaning 2X the demand of glass)
  Also 2mm glass globally except europe use heat strengthened bcoz they were not able to fully manufacture a tempered glass - however
     tempered glass is stronger compared to heat strengthened and that too with zero price difference 
As of now all the glass which company manufactures is very low in antimony but once demand comes for antimony free then the 
   company is ready with the technology
efficiency : currently 73% glass(from furnace) is converted to tempered glass => so there is a lot of work to do here
acquisiton of Interfloat and GMB (European glass manufacturing companies) to expand in europe and become a global glass manufacturing
  company - < 3GW is manufactured in Europe locally providing a huge oppurtunity as the market size there is 20 GW, also 
  glass prices are high in Europe compared to India so more profits for the company as in In Europe, the domesticity of the source 
  of supply is very important and bcoz of stable supply chain guarantee large volume consumers they do not compare the
   prices with imported prices.

--External Growth oppurtunities
Macroeconomic: 
Solar is the cheapest form of energy in renewable sector
14 Gigawatts of solar module manufacturing capacity exists in India, actual production was about 5.5 Gigawatts during the financial
 year 2021. We see installed capacity rising to 50 Gigawatts of solar panels within the next three year
Tailwinds:
Lot of Govt support - BCD, PLI etc
bcoz of BCD PV modules will be made in India and they will buy glass from Indian manufacturers bcoz people who are going to make
 modules using domestic glass will be earning more money than people who are importing glass bcoz of PLI scheme and also to 
 secure their supply chain they will opt for Indian suppliers
Exports - A very good potential to increase exports to Europe, Americas, Russia, Turkey and MENA due to renewed focus on domestic
  modules manufacturing in Solar PV in their respective countries to secure the supply chain
  China+1 strategy to import PV modules from India which will increase the demand for glass 

---- Sustainability of Earning power: MOATS and Pricing Power to make it a long term bet
1)Competettive advantage/MOAT Check?
Economises of Scale - target
Low cost producer - target
Intangible assets - lot of patented products
Entry barriers - none in the near term domestically as getting in to this space takes time, spending money etc and by then
  borosil  might have gotten that brand name and first mover adavantage with huge market share

2)PRICING POWER (MUST HAVE MOAT): prices are dependent on the international prices and import prices
  if borosil renewables increases the prices customers have a choice to import.
  will prices of solar glass rise for the next couple of years? - depends on demand and supply


3) Longterm vs short term bet
/Preferred Investment: Both MOATS and Earnings Growth oppurtunities need to exist for sustainable Earnings
/Company with No Moats  but very high growth oppurtunities - a short term buy becuase other competetiors with MOATS can take away the
market share soon - need to monitor closely
/Company with good MOATS but not very good growth oppurtunities - it has become a slow grower(if they genrate a stable free cashflow
you can use the cash to buy other growth and non-growth businesses) 
Note: Don't forget to compare dividend yield with FD interest rates


----Capital Allocation 
//SOURCE OF CAPITAL - Debt + New Equity


//USE OF NEW/INCREMENTAL CAPITAL : A good company always uses capital for progressing and next phase growth and not for survival 
Organic growth - putting back the money in the same business
Capex - new (mostly)
R&D


//RETURN ON CAPITAL
Good company: ROCE/ROIC(return on capital) > WACC (cost of cpital)
Very Good company: ROCE/ROIC(return on capital) >>> WACC (cost of cpital)
Ideal company : if it can redeploy the incremental capital for same/high returns over time - it becomes a compounding machine

// SUMMARY (Business Quality Check) - decided by PAST, PRESENT and FUTURE of the company
  -Predictable and consistent/recurring EARNINGS for next 10 yrs(MOATS, pricing power)
  -Competes on value rather than price bcoz company that competes on value is like a magnet with stronger magnetic field  that
    attracts customers and companies which compete on price will lose their business to competetiors
  -prefer high margin non commoditized business - if commoditized then must be a low cost producer
  -lousy industry/highly competettive industry/niche industry(no big players have entered yet) ?
  -proxy play on some capital intensive/debt heavy/lousy industry ? 
  -Superior economics (what does company produce, target audience and how does it produce): ESG Principles
   Environmental: does the process/products cause any kind of pollution
   Social: does the products/services add some value to customers or do they waste their time or money or destroy their health
   Governance: Superior Management and board of directors
  -Scalable business model - globally preferred (mutibagger are made because of this property)
  -Company having calibre or potential to adapt to the changing business environment - having said that invest 
    in a business with slow rate of change, rapid change is the enemy of an investor as it needs more capital to adapt and 
    burns more cash to be in the competettion)
  -Having Tailwinds is an added advantage as it boosts the process of wealth creation and helps u in achieving goal faster

----------------------------------- RISKS ----------------------------------------
check Risk_Check.txt
---Business Risk:
1)demand is linked to domestic module manufacturing in the country - Recent announcements by various Module Manufacturers/
  Solar Plant Developers to add 37 GW of module manufacturing capacity taking the same to about 50 GW over next 3 years
Note 1: but Glass like any other component of solar module is left out to be decided whether it is to be sourced locally or imported
Note 2: Two maufacturers already said they will create a glass manufacturing unit and backward  for captive consumption and secure
  their supply chain
2)The government of India has been protecting the domestic manufacturers through anti-dumping duty and countervailing duty on imports.
 Hence, any change in the current policy or increase in supply by importers, could impact BRL’s turnover and profitability.
Even if govt removes both the rules - Present domestic demand > BRL’s post-expansion capacity, robust growth in the sector in domestic
 manufacturing of modules, current high share of imports and high growth in exports = Easy absorption of additional production volumes
 check/monitor inventory levels to confirm
Note: pricing power might be impacted as china comes in picture if CVD, ADD duties are removed, also Malayasia the largest
  manufacturer of solar glass can literally service the whole demand of solar glass in India but indian manufacturers choose to be
  stable geo-politically and locally source them to eliminate forex risk and supplychain issues
3)soda ash and raw material cost increase and prices are decreasing globally can impact margins


---Financial Risk:
1)soda ash cost increased by 60% - if selling price of glass doesn't increase there will be margin compression
almost all the competetiors import the raw materials and hence this is true for all the competetiors and hence to counter this 
  selling price will be increased
2)since mode of capex funding is debt + equity: focus on return ratios ROE/ROIC/ROCE for the next 2-3 yrs
i.e return on incremental capital shouldn't be hampered
3)As of now glass prices are low and heavily fluctuating every 10 days due to demand and supply issues as china controls 90-95%
   of global market share(however demand is expected to raise exponentially in the future)
  Also lot of inventory stacking is being done by chinese companies and when inventories rise beyond control, they try to 
    liquidate the stocks at lesser price which creates a ripple in the market in terms of the price fluctuation
  Clients ask companies to match the import prices

---Management Risk:

---Investment Returns Risk: cyclical nature


---------------------------------- VALUATION --------------------------------------
future cash flow prediction - DCF method
check tickertape and  morning star for valuation confirmation
check Valuation_Check.txt
50 GW is the module manufacturing capacity after 5 yrs => actual production is 70% of 50 GW => 35 GW
out of which borosil assuming that it has 40% market share (after all the capex) => 14 GW 
currently borosil is servicing hopw much => 35% of 5.5 GW => 2 GW
if glass price and raw materials price remians same profits will increase 7X but conservatively lets take margin of safety
 and assume 4X in 8 yrs even then you will make a 20% CAGR return on your money

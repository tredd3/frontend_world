  -proxy play on some industry ? 
  -Lousy industriy Survivor: operating in boring/lousy industries where no one wants to enter or companies in that sector
   facing heavy loses and low profitability or no growth, hence the Survivor

  market share capture
Relaxo - target the low end customers (where other players won't enter bcoz of low revenues and high costs)

Bajaj Finance - globally competettive - No, but 75% NBFCs are crap hence strongest players like Bajaj Finance will eventually capture

  capture market share, HDFC bank is growing both assets and liabilities  at double digit growth

4)double digit intrinsic value growth
Asian paints - CFO used in capex and dividends, decreasing ROCE on incremental capital, globally competettive - Yes, Credit Rating : AAA
 cash generated from paints business is reinvested in home furnishing sector, pricing power + market share gain during COVID
 home furnishing sector is mostly unorganised and the the oppurtunity is 50X its revenue

Jubiliant food works - generate cash and use the cash to expand stores, solo licensee for dominos in India and neighbouring countries,
   pricing power and lot of scope for fastfood in india due to youth population 
Berger Paints - like Asian paints it has cracked the code to sustain and be successful in paints industry (i.e dealers inventory
  replenishment is fast, demand forecasting ability) , inefficiencies of Asian paints are opputunities by Berger and hence Berger
  acts like a hedge to Asian paints and capture the maximum growth of paints industry itself

----------------------------- Contra portfolio ---------------------------------- 
Check : who is selling and why are they selling (promoter selling needs investigation) 

1) Undervalued index funds/sector etfs/largecaps/nifty 100 stocks/super investors top holding/moated small/midcaps

Indiamart - using lower fee to woo customers and create network effect, generate cash and reinvest in companies creating digital
   ecosystem for MSME, globally competettive - No, CFO used in short term investments, constant returns on incremental capital
IGL/GGL - CDG companies, reducing gas prices is +ve for these companies - especially with govt push to increase gas share in energy
   mix to 15% from 6% at present gives scope for double digit volume growth. Entry barriers in given geographical area for 10+ yrs
Deepak Nitrite - solvents (import oppurtunity), downstream products, entry to flourine space, backward integration(cost advantage),

  gain oppurtunities, Export is difficult because of transportation, competettion from china but most of their production is for
  captive consumption


------------------------------- VC portfolio ---------------------------------
Turnarounds OR
sunrise industry OR 
about to be profitable OR
less market share and having low base of profits

//Indigo paints
Business : 
  4% market share
  slowly building distribution network
  margin improvements with highest gross margin across industry
  cash is used for brand building, acquistion, capex
Financials: almost negligble debt, ROCE 21%
MOATS :
Management/Promoter : MD is a chemical engineer from IIT & Stanford, he is also the promoter
Strengths : low profit base
Risks : 
   intense competettion from players like asian and berger, unorganised players
   almost no pricing power
Valuation :

Tarsons - Very good financials, Transition from Glassware to plasticware - giving scope for double digit volume
Borosil Renewables - macroeconomic oppurtunity both in india and europe, but no pricing power as prices are decided globally
  Lack of Product Diversification: The company derives 100% of its revenue from the sale of tempered solar glass
  Domestic manufacturing of solar modules requires supply of solar glass - if solar module is imported then gone
  GOI has been protecting the domestic manufacturers through anti-dumping duty any change in policy can impact the firm - Also China escaping CVD, ADD by shifting manufacturing base to Malaysia, Vietnam etc
  China as the World’s largest PV glass producer accounts for over 95% of the total solar glass capacity.
  Chinese manufacturers are aggressively raising their solar glass production capacities  causing demand supply mismatch which can result in surplus capacity for glass and depress prices and margins.
Moldtek Packaging - CFO used in capex, 25% constant ROCE on incremental capital, globally competettive - No, Credit Rating :  A+
 strong clients and oppurtunity for market share gain
Galaxy surfactants - CFO used in capex, divdends | 25% constant ROCE on incremental capital, Credit Rating : AA-, Proxy play on 
world FMCG market , focusing on transistion demand from petro to oleo chemicals , moderate pricing power bcoz of competettion
Suprajit - lower end of value chain, but will volumes be double digit? need to findout
Rajratan Global wires - lower end of value chain , fluctuating margins as prices are linked to steel, competettion from China
   but will volumes be double digit? need to findout
AU small finance bank/AAVAS financers/HOME FIRST/FIVE STAR - home, MSME lending (strong small players with good asset quality 
  even in COVID)
  FIVE STAR - spread in south
  AAVAS financers - Rajasthan, Maharastra etc
  HOME FIRST - Gujarat, Maharastra
  

-------------------------------- Eliminated -----------------------------------
Radico - ESG concerns won't bring in much funds , institutional holding is already high and states control everything from production
   to prices, taxes etc - they can ban liquor anytime they want

IRCTC - no pricing power , Puppet in the hands of Railways (ok for a short term buy if valuations improve)

TTK Prestige - good balance sheet, but Avg ROE(15%) and NPM (10%) - weaker economics (only few products of Prestige has
  brand loyalty + replacement time is high and target audience reduces to poulation/5, i.e families)

MTAR - equity grwth is zero and ROE is less, bargaining power of consumers exists bcoz of the limited clients, Govt is the major
  customer hence working capital cycle is high, not globally diversified, orders acquired via bidding - no pricing power

MCX - cyclical and completely unpredictable , no growth opputunities as it is already a monopoly and NO Global scope, 
   ZERO pricing power as SEBI and Govt interferes

CDSL, BSE - macroeconomic oppurtunity, but suseptible to market cycles because most of the revenues are linked to transaction,
       lower end of value chain, SEBI controls the pricing. No Global expansion oppurtunities, cash generated is given as dividends
       as there are no oppurtunities to deploy, since it already holds 50% market share and it cannot put money in non-core 
       business. Also it Better to play with consumption rather than investing of individuals as 75% Indian population is poor

CAMS  - over the years MF transaction will only increase , SIP amount will increase and not decrease
       but pricing power is not in hands of CAMS and revenue model is volume based pricing, also the rate at which revenues
       will grow is also lower because CAMS is a the lower end of value chain and earns very little amount(0.0001%) of the 
       transaction amount, Not globally scalable, No market share gain oppurtunity as it already has highest share 

CRISIL - high valuations, repeat and fixed customers, CFO used in dividends, decreasing ROCE on incremental capital, 
  globally competettive - Yes but i purchased the shares of its parent SPGI which is a 65% shareholder of CRISIL
  Also CRISIL dividends partially cover the expenses of SPGI, SPGI does share buyback & acquistion apart from dollar appreciation
  of the investment

Saregama - capital intensive business(with upfront payment) - over the years , the catelogue gets old &  people always need fresh songs
highly competettive industry - hence margins not under control
any new person with lot of money can disrupt this business - as there is no differentiation that Saregama provides
unpredictable - never know which song will be a hit, which movie will be a hit
low margin business (Hence profits from frequently played songs will cover the losses for other songs and profits/margins will always be less)

DrLalPathlabs - 
company has not increased prices much in 5 years because of intense competition in this industry and focussed majorly on volumes.
commoditised
any person with large capital can compete in this business and offer lesser price
Most of the complex tests are done in hospital 
no export oppurtunities
if it enters B2B market with hospital chains - they need to provide discounts
unless there is tech and scale - it is difficult for dr lal to get high margins
Note: we invest in Tarsons, proxy to diagnostic companies

Balkrishna Industries - limited pricing power as said by management, heavily dependent on Europe & US volumes 
        Other established companies are also present in this area - along with on road tyre presence  
        +ves - low labour cost, 
Note: we invest in rajratan global wire, proxy to tyre companies

IEX - NO pricing power - rates controlled by power board, globally competettive - No, new competettion came in the picture, 
  companies preferring captive power consumption, long term power agreements to secure supply chain

KRBL - fully integrated basmati rice producer.
Also has non-basmati rice portfolio
use of cash : establish rice mills in Gujarat, Maharashtra and Karnataka +  Dividend + buyback 
Has captive power plants (using rice husk to produce power)
By-products such as rice bran are effectively utilised for producing Rice Bran Oil, Furfural Oil, Furfural Alcohol, Cattle feed etc
Focus on premium portfolio for exports - although they also have mass segment 
Ethanol opportunity with broken rice ?
Risks: no pricing power due to commodity nature of business, low sector growth rate, Govt can ban exports and 
  import country regulations (meaning no control on volumes and price), cyclical cashflows due to rice prices
  inventory can lose value
  export duty can make rice costly to importers compared to other global suppliers

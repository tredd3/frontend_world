2)why are they selling?
  //Check RISKS section. Did any of the risk played out ?
  //Internal factors: temporary/short-term problem(can be a buy oppurtunity):
    weak quarterly financial,
    weak guidance in the short term,
    high debt,
    loss making (very careful in this situation)
    subsidaries not making profits
  //Internal factors: permanent/longterm problem (can be a value trap):
     promoter related scams, 
     obselete business,
     MOAT break,
     continous market share loss due to increased competettion
     regulatory changes
  //External factors: mostly a buying oppurtunity, provided the earnings keep growing or have less impact
     year end tax selling(nov - dec in US, feb - march in India)
     high valuation stocks correct in bear markets - bcoz earnings will become slow
     macroeconomy concerns -  govt intervention, demand slow down, inflation, high interest rates
     uncertain situation/surprise events like (Financial Crisis, COVID, RUSSIA UKRAINE war)
     forced selling  - due to dermergers
     profit booking to invest in other attractive asset class or other companies
         for e.g: in 2020 people sold stocks and invested in GOLD
         Also in 2022, FIIs sold stocks to invest in US bonds @7% interest)
3)Check if it is a value trap: 
 what is a value trap? stock available at low price but it might stay there for few years OR it might decrease further if the 
 valuation is high
4)why did you buy the stock? - go through the story
   did the story/fundamentals change? if it significantly changed/impacted then you can sell

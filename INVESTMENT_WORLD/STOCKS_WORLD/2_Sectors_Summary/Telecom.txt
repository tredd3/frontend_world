Telecom - no moats, commodity type service and high regualatoty oversight 
capital intensive business
strong financial strength needed to continously upgrade and improve network and technology (hence generally have high debt)
high fixed cost business (i.e during low demand where revenues can't suffice u need to pay from reserves or even take debt)
highly competetive industry (i.e firms compete on price hence margins are thin)
highly regulated industry (firms need to be flexible enough to change their tariff structure and streamline operations)
any technology advantages can be easily wiped off by competetitiors by providing similar service
keep in mind to check:
debt, margins, operating leverage (extremely high compared to peers can be deadly combined with high debt)


//How mobile communication works?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JZG9x_VOwA&ab_channel=Lesics  
microphone -> converts voice to digital signal using a sensor
transmitting antenna -> converts digital signal(0,1) to analog signal (electromagnetic waves)
electromagnetic waves lose energy while travelling bcoz of physical objects, environmental factors etc
  Note: even though , the obstacles are not present even then they cannot travel forever because of earth's curved structure
Hence cell towers are introduced using cellular technology

cellular technology:
  A given area is divided in to hexagonal cells, with each cell having its own tower and frequency slot
  these towers are connected via optical fiber, laid underground, under sea or over the air
  electromagnetic waves produced by the phone are picked up by the tower in your cell and convert them in to high frequency
   light signals and sends it to destination tower
  destination tower then converts these light signals back to electromagnetic waves and send it to destination mobile phone

receiving antennas - converts analog signal (electromagnetic waves) to  digital signal(0,1)
speaker - converts digital signal to voice signals using a sensor

every telecom operator has a frequency slot dedicated
they allocate different frequency slots to each cell tower
the frequncy slot per tower is further distributed to all the active customers(attending calls) in that area
i.e each customer has a dedicated frequency band

1G- only call
2G- call, sms, data
3G- call, sms, high speed data (audio + video)
4G- high speed due to multiple transmitting & receiving antennas both in mobile and towers

//How Internet works:
https://www.netnod.se/i-root/what-are-root-name-servers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3c1ih2NJEg&ab_channel=Lesics

using complex network of optical fibre cables
every device (server/pc/mobile/wifi router/ISP provider router) etc is identified via ip address in that network
ip address is provided by ISP providers, they also have a DNS info
browser makes a request to DNS server , gets the ip and connects directly to the server
The server sends the data to the source local ISP provider via optical cables -> source regional ISP provider via optical cables ->
 source national ISP provider via optical cables -> international ISP provider -> routes data to destination national ISP provider 
 via optical fibre cables on ground & sea -> destination regional ISP provider via optical cables -> destination local ISP provider
 via optical cables -> to homes/businesses via optical cables -> inside homes and businesses via routers
between each ISP provider there are multiple routers (meaning there are multiple ways to take a packet from source ISP to destination ISP)
data that needs to be transferred is divided in to multiple packets and send via multiple routes for parallelisation and speed

ICANN is an organisation in the US that manges ip address assignment, domain name registration, 

//Why Do Computers Use 1s and 0s?


 
//Situation in India
Telecos heavily relies on imports - atmnirbhar bharat and PLI schemes can be game changers
 The cost of data per GB (gigabyte) per month in India is the lowest in the world at USD 0.09.
 the cost per GB is still very low (USD0.70 in Bangladesh, USD1.12 in Malaysia, and USD1.23 in Thailand). This cost stands at USD8 in the US.
Meanwhile, the cost incurred by Indian companies to maintain networks is almost similar to that of their global peers.
No Telecom company in India has generater ROIC > WACC in the last 20 yrs
Also after deploying 5G in the foreign countries, no telecom company has seen profits/ARPU increase bcoz of 5G services
Total 4 players - Airtel, Jio, VI, BSNL
//Oppurtunities
Least ARPU in India(2$ per user) possessing significant oppurtunities for Indian players interms of revenue growth and 
 profits(but TRAI is the blocker)
Globally - Indonesia($2.8), China ($6.8), US ($36.7)
~$2 ARPU : 6% ROCE. ~$3.3 ARPU : ~20% ROCE. 
//postpaid oppurtunity - india (96% prepaid , 4% postpaid ) - world Avg (70% prepaid, 30% postpaid) (but very difficult to 
 achieve this as Indians are price sensistive and postpaid plans are much higher than prepaid)
//Broadband oppurtunity - however there is huge competettion in this market and something like starlink can disrupt this

//Airtel - 32% market share, ARPU - 154, 35cr customers
 has a clear focus on its high-value customers since this segment is most likely to absorb reasonable tariff hikes, there is no 
  pressing need for the telco to do so, as it currently leads the market in terms of Arpu (INR157 vs. INR140 for Jio and INR114 for Vi in Q1 FY21).
Airtel with the bold of 255 tariff rise has reiterated its strategic focus on high-Arpu subscribers.

//Jio
Given its ambition of 500 million subscribers by 2023, it is unlikely to raise tariffs. Instead, Jio would want to cash in on this
 opportunity to increase its subscriber base 
Jio 70% of smartphone subscribers contribute 80% of revenue.

//Vi
Vi certainly needs an immediate hike in tariff of around 100%, as it would boost its Arpu (average revenue per user) and strengthen
  books, besides restoring investors’ confidence, which can eventually translate into fresh fund infusion. 
However, since Vi has a larger share of low-Arpu subscribers, raising the low-end tariffs could backfire
Vi has the lowest number of smartphone users (just over 40%) out of total subscribers, but it realises 70% of its revenue from them.
 The remaining 60% of its feature-phone subscribers contribute 30% to its revenue. So even if it loses some part of this 60% 
 feature-phone subscribers to competition, the impact on revenue will not be high. 


//Conclusion
But telecom is an esessential/Utility service that is needed by every individual throughout their lifetime. so bet on the 
companies which provide services to telecom operators (like sterlite technologies which provide optical cable upgradation services,
 Tejas networks(telecom network parts/hardware) etc)

Business services: 
we can find excellent businesses with wide moats
Generally companies outsource their non-core tasks to third parties to save time and money.
these taks are the core business of business services companies
i)tech based: data processing(cloud services),database providers, registry sevices, card payment network
there is competetion but growth opputunities are so high that all the competetitiors/peers enjoy a decent growth
hence in such scenarios frims don't compete on price rather they focus on capex/expansion
low capital requirements(no advertising,capex,R&D and warehouse costs)
hence look for companies with higher operating leverage, high free cash flow
high entry barriers (look for companies with large scale operations)
generally operate on long-term contracts(look for stable financial performance)
look for companies which provide a wide range of services (companies want to consolidate their purchases and maintain relations with few firms)
ii)people based: advertising, consulting and professional services(rating agencies,TCS,Accenture), staffing
money made = money billed from client  - salary paid - other costs
need to hire best talent and pay more salaries else they might lose clients(hence look for companies that hires freshers 
regulary and trains them to reduce the overall cost by paying them low salaries)
But when economy goes down these type of companies lose clients and their profits take a hit
Generally have narrow moats and highly competetive industry(so look for companies with strong client relationship)
Also look for brands that provide differentiated services at low cost - they tend to have wide MOATS
iii)hard assets based: waste management, airlines, logistics
airlines - better to avoid bcoz of their huge fixed costs and still they sell a commodity service
heavily rely on incremental fixed costs to grow their business(hence more debt in balance sheet)
Having debt is justified if the company can earn the cost of capital(to service both equity and debt) using its assets
check fixed assets turnover ratio for this Fixed-asset turnover is the ratio of sales to the value of fixed assets. 
It indicates how well the business is using its fixed assets to generate sales.
MOATS:
brand
size
barrier to entry
Trust by large companies
Note: preference - tech based > people based > hard asset based
Look at the earnings growth rate expectations from PEG ration if it is unrealestic then wait for correction at realistic growth rate
if not u can avoid the stock

HEALTHCARE - defensive - globally competetive
Industry : hospitals, Pharma, biotech, medical devices, diagnosis centers, Health insurance
wide economic moated industries - pharma(bcoz of patents), medical devices(bcoz of switching costs)

//2 types of drug companies - generic(copy cats producing drugs at low prices in high volumes) and branded(innovators and patent holder)
Note: ironically generic drug companies are gaining popularity as they bring down healthcare costs significantly
drug development process:
- preclinical testing(on animals)
- human clinical trials - phae 1, 2 and 3
- once phase 3 trial is successful then the company files application with all the regualtory bodies in the world
- fate of the drug is literally in the hands of Regulatory authorities
/if rejected then it back to starting point figuring out what went wrong and fixing them and going through the whole testing 
and approval process again which might take years
/if accepted : company enjoys monopoly for that particular drug for about 20 yrs but as the patent is filed as soon as the 
drug/chemical compound is identified, 8-10 yrs is eaten up during testing and approval years
-once the patent is expired drug now becomes generic which means other generic drug companies copy the composition, manufacture it
 and sell them at extremely low prices affecting the parent company which innopvated the product

//Biotech firm: this industry runs on probability and luck
discover drugs using cellular and molecular process rather than chemical process(like pharma companies)
high risk, requires lot of luck and expertise - better to avoid

//Medical devices firm:
catering to old population (cardiac and orthopedic surgeries)
patent protection for instruments/devices
having high switching costs(both in terms of surgeons training and costs to hospital managment) and 
long term clinical histories - acts as barriers for new entrants
pricing power as the costs are covered by insurance companies(devices firms comfortably increases price every year)
low regulatory risk: improvements in devices industry is evolutionary, meaning next product verions are made better than previous 
products, unlike in phama where improvements are revolutionary, meaning a completely new drug can replace the exisiting drugs
orthopedic devices has high switching costs but cardiac devices has low switching costs, hence companies has to spend a good amount 
on R&D to come up with a new product ans stay in the competetion.
PS: product innovation and diversification is must for these companies

//Health Insurance/Managed care:
intense regulatory pressure
it is not an attractive business bcoz of the rising healthcare costs can wipe out profits
2 types of operations: risk based(underwriting medical insurance for premiums), fee based(monitoring, claims processings etc)
fee based busniess is more predicatable and profitable bcoz rising healthcare costs are taken up by employers
limited exposure to govt funded programs is preferred because govt doesn't increase reimbursements inline with healthcare costs

MOATS: 
high entry barriers - it takes several years for developing a product through R&D, involving high startup costs and regulatory approval
 also physicians always prefer medicines/medical devices with proven track record 
Patent validity/protection - there is no competettion for price and mostly health insurance covers the costs so price 
 is also high and end customers don't care about it
significant product differentiation
Economies of scale
strong sales/marketting capabilities i.e tieups with physicians

Risks:
R&D heavy - Drug development is costly, time consuming(like 5-10 yrs) and no guarantee of success
Govt and regualatoty requirements can have deep impact on pricing power for the whole sector
Look for:
drugs with increasing sales growth(and having high potential catering to wider audience like sugar,bp, cancer,cholestral and heart related etc)
look for pharma companies with a pipeline of drugs in the clinical trials
high patent validity of drugs - if validity is less then 1 and 3 points are must
high acceptency rates with the regulators
Drug companies whose products target wider audience or significant unmet needs - can make better margins compared to niche products

Note: take Big margin of safety for Pharma companies with certain drugs making up large % of sales

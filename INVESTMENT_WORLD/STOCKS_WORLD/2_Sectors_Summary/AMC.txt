https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_funds_in_India
https://groww.in/mutual-funds/filter - look for all the types of products for a given mutual fund y selecting filters
revenue: % of recurring investments/SIPs
major expense : compensation of managers
keep an eye on operating expense
economies of scale: excellent (as it doesn't require more managers when the asset size to manage increases)
no capex, R&D and debt needed
loss is beared by customer unlike bank and isnurance business
40% of AUM is managed by just 3 AMCs in India

MOAT check:
market share (smaller firms find it difficult to sustain the competetion)
more assets: total AUM YOY growth and absolute numbers compared to peers
companies with higher % of equity assets gain more
longterm solid track recored( required to attract investors)
diversification of products(investment in multiple asset classes)
diversification of investors
uniqueness of products if any like international investing, tax saving funds etc
stickiness of assets(money that stays in the firm even when times are tough)
AUM growth reason ? market prices/ net inflows are more
check for net inflows > net outflows in both bull and bear markets
CAMS(back office work) - only profitable if it deals with scale - need to spend on Technology

RISK:
extremely competetive industry - bcoz of high margins and economies of scale, lot of firms enter in to this business
people might stop SIPs and invest directly in stocks
new prodcut launches(like sector ETFs,international investing) from other firms can take away the prfoits - need to monitor
SEBI regulates MFs and they cannot invest in certain asset classes beyond a fixed %

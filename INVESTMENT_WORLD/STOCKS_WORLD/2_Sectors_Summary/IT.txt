IT - defensive - globally competetive - high margins
highly competettive industry - low barriers to entry - high barriers to success
less capital required to build a software
like FMCG they generate a lot of cash
Generally have clean balance sheets with Zero debt
Excellent growth prospects bcoz businesses keep upgrading with latest software that can make business run smoothly and cut costs
services based: no significant cost
product based: R&D costs
Attractive segments: Security(antivirus, firewalls), IOT, AI, ML, BlockChain

LOOK FOR:
niche players like Adobe who has low competetion and strong Moats
Economies of Scale(once a software is developed revenue from new customer goes to bottom line)
company with Large customer base (that are Loyal to the company)
Great management(especially that don't give away ESPOs easily)

FINANCIALS:
License revenue(new softwares sold) trend should be increasing in general and also as a % of sales
Deffered revenue (cash recieved by the company even before service delivery) - indicated strong future revenues
if License revenues and Deffered revenues are declining then company's business has started to slow down
excellent track records in both the economy cycles (sales and profit margins)

MOATS:
narrow moat with most of the the firms
high switching costs (most of the customers train their employees and they can't spend again and again)
Network effect (certain products are used by large no of people)
Brand Name (people don't buy random software due to security issues)

RISK:
today's winner can be tomorrow's loser if the competetitior can develop a better product at a better price
don't invest blindly if u don't find a MOAT and not getting at a discount to intrinsic value(bcoz the pace at which technology is 
growing it is difficult to predict how software firms look like in the future)

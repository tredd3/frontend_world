MOATS:



------------------------------- Company picks and Reasons -----------------------------
Focus on expenses compared to peers(managing expenses is extremely important)
  shouldn't over pay its executives
  shouldn't allure customers by providing them food or stuff for free bcoz it's unnecessary expense
  should pay/treat workers properly
  should hire good talent and focus on safety
should be a low cost service provider
shouldn't keep buying airplanes using debt to fly to infrequent or fancy locations (high distance foreign locations)
Rather it should fly planes frequently to low distance locations
In this way such companies keep capturing market share

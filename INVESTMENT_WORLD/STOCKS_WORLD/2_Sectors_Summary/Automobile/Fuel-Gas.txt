 ------------------------------- Economics -----------------------------
 considering cyclic nature of Renewables (solar and wind), Natural Gas and Renewables are going to stay together to complement each other. 
 In this energy transition journey, Natural Gas shall be at the center stage for 3 to 5 decades, where it ensures energy security and
 at the same time supports decarbonization.

Demand: 
  power and fertiliser sectors are heavy users
  fertiliser sector, chief consumer of gas, meets around 70% of its requirement through imports
  CGD (city gas distribution) 
Supply: 
  Imports - 44% of its natural-gas needs through LNG imports in 2023 (reduced from 54% due to high spot prices and increased domestic gas supply)
  However Domestic supplies will decrease after 4-5 yrs and demand keeps decreasing 
  Domestic production: RIL has dicovered the largest gas filed in the country + ONGC producing
  RIL-BP combine is developing three deepwater gas discoveries which by 2023, meeting up to 15% of the country’s gas demand.
Gas pricing is revised bi-anually based on four global benchmarks — US Henry Hub, Canada Alberta gas, UK NBP, and Russian Natural Gas
both oil and gas has central excise and VAT that add significantly to the actual production prices 
Note: VAT is meant for State government and Central Excise Tax is levied by central government. Central excise Tax is levied up on
 manufacture of excisable goods in India. But VAT is charges at the time sale of goods within the state
E.g: fuel, tobacco, alcohol

//GAS INFRA IN INDIA
LNG terminal capacity is expected to grow from current 42.5 MMTPA to around 72 MMTPA in 3 years (all owned by petronet LNG)
But to achieve 15% gas share in energy mix by 2030, india needs 150 MMTPA capacity
Transmission pipeline network is expected to grow from ~20,000 km to around 35,000 km by 2023 (to be built by Gail)
 Also Unified gas pipeline tarif where gas users located far away from the source of gas will not have to pay cascading tarif, boosting demand
CGD network now shall cover 88% of area and 98% of Indian population. With increased penetration level of CGD network,
 the gas consumption has potential to increase many-fold at right and sustainable prices.


//SupplyChain
CNG (gas) -  compressed gas 
LNG (liquid) - occupies less volume compared to CNG
LNG fueling stations require complex cryogenic equipment and is more complicated to use in vehicles
import gas via containers -> LNG(only 2 terminals) managed by petronet -> carried by GAIL, IOCL, BPCL -> CGD, petrol bunks ets
In India, the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG), Government of India (GoI), exercises control over allocation of
  natural gas produced in the country
MoPNG has been extending domestic natural gas to the maximum extent to the CGD players under the Administered Price Mechanism (APM)
  so that CGD players can supply to PNG-Domestic and CNG segments
CGD players have to rely on imported RLNG for meeting the requirement of PNG-Industrial and PNG-Commercial segments


//Sectors directly affected due to gas
ceramics - used in industry for cutting
natural gas is used to produce power and fertilisers, turned into CNG for vehicles, and piped to household kitchens.


//Competettion:
Domestic 
International (Russia, MiddleEast, US, )

-------------------------------- Stats -------------------------------
per capita energy consumption is around one third of world’s average.
Coal - 55% (world - 26%)
Oil - 28% (world - 31%)
Renewables - 6% (world - 7%)
Nat gas - 6% (world - 24%) - India's target to increase the share to 15% by 2030
Hydro - 4% (world - 6%)
Nuclear - 1% (world - 4%)

//Gas consumption by sectors:
Fertilisers: 30% - biggest gas consumer in India and it consumes the majority of imported LNG.
CGD : 20% - The city gas distribution (CGD) sector demand for gas is rising but LNG's share is muted as end industrial consumers 
  switch to alternative fuels such as propane. Almost 97% domestic gas produced in Indiua goes to CGD due to low cost
Power: 14% - Demand from the power sector remains weak due to the higher costs of LNG over domestic gas
Refinery - 6.7%
Petrochemicals - 3.3%
remaining - 22%

government is targeting 30% penetration of electric by the end of 2030, but that still leaves 70% of the market that will 
  be ICE technology (ethanol blended petrol, CNG vehicles will lead)
Last year, the CNG market was around 100,000 units in a 3 million passenger car market.
Going forward, as we see 800-1,000 CNG stations added every year, we will see steep growth in this market.
Gujarat is the highest natural gas-consuming state, with around 40% of total domestic natural gas consumption in the country


------------------------------- Risk -----------------------------
subject to heavy price regulations - incase of domestic gas
global demand supply mismatch can make prices volatile - incase of LNG
LNG prices kept decreasing for last 10 yrs, barring last 2 yrs where prices abnormally increased due to global issues
when the prices keep increasing, volumes decrease as consumers look for alternative fuel - longterm contacts can mtigate this risk
domestic gas production may stagnate in couple of years , but hydrogen and biogas can take its place - limiting market share gains for LNG

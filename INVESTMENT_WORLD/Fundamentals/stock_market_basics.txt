******** why stock prices go up and down ********
Mechanism:
1)Demand and supply of shares
More shares are in demand(more people want to buy) - supply is less(limited stocks available or few people want to sell)
Closing price of a share in a day:  End of the day weighted avg price of the shares sold is published by exchange
2)Factors that drive demand and supply
Annual report
Earning report
Products 
Legal cases/ scams
News
How do you interpret the data is important bcoz is data is available with everybody


******** How corporate actions impact stock price *********
1)Bonus Issue - freely given to share holders
1:1 bonus issue, the share market price will fall by 50%, FV remains the same
3:1 bonus shares - 3 bonus shares for 1 share held
1:3 bonus shares - 1 bonus share for 3 shares held
Ex-bonus date - need to buy shares before this date to get bonus shares in ur demat
Record date - bonus shares get deposited in demat on this date
However, over the long term, and as stock price increases, investors tend to gain. 
Impact : The share price falls in the same proportion as the bonus issue ratio.

2)rights issue - share holder has an option to buy
fresh shares are issued by a company to its existing shareholders at a discounted price.
It could either be for debt reduction or to finance the company’s expansion.
FV remains same and market value gets adjusted based on (current market price + new price offered )/total shares
Impact :The share price falls in the same proportion as the rights issue.

3)dividend - quoted per share or as a percentage of the face value of the share.
Also, when a company does not find any appropriate investment opportunity to deploy its funds, it declares a dividend to share its profits/reserves with the shareholders.
Impact : Share price usually declines in line with the level of dividend paid per share.

4)Stock Split - face value and market price of share decreases, so that small investors can invest
used primarily by companies that have seen their share prices increase substantially.
The number of outstanding shares increases and the price per share decreases, the market capitalization (and the value of the company) does not change.
Advantage: make shares more affordable to smaller investors, liquidity increases and more buyers and sellers trade in the stock, which, in turn, helps discover its true value.
E.g:  if the stock’s face value is Rs 10, and there is a 1:1 split, its face value will change to Rs 5. Accordingly, the market value also gets adjusted.
//Bonus shares are issued, the new shares will have same face value as that of old ones but  Market prices will decrease. 
Advantage: more dividend income

5)buyback
company purchases its shares from shareholders, usually at a premium to the market price. Companies go for buybacks to consolidate their stake in the enterprise and for greater control, to support the share price from declining, to improve earnings per share (as it reduces the number of outstanding shares in the market)
Also They make use of free cash flows to buyback shares

6)take over: acquisition of a public company by another company
In a takeover, the company making the bid is the acquirer and the company it wishes to take control of is called the target
the acquiring company agrees to pay a certain dollar amount for each share of the target company's stock.


7)delisting: https://groww.in/blog/what-happens-when-a-stock-is-delisted/
volutanty: 
Promoter or acquirer will buy back the shares through a reverse book building process.
The final price is decided based on the price at which the maximum number of shares has been offered. 
involuntary: 
within one year time frame all ur stocks should be sold to promoters. The promoters must take ur shares at a specific price
decided by investment banking company. if u want even more price u can hold and sell the shares via OTC (not recommended though)

Grey Market is the term used to describe unregulated over-the-counter market for trading IPO applications and IPO shares before the stock is listed at a stock market. This is a way for dealers to support their customers who may want to exit before listing.
There are two kinds of transactions that happen in the IPO grey market:
* Trade of IPO shares at a grey market premium
* Trade of IPO application at a kostak.
GMP or Grey Market Premium is the premium at which equity shares from the IPO are being traded in the grey market. This could either be a positive or negative – meaning the trading price in the grey market is either higher or lower than issue price respectively, based on demand and supply for the shares.
Typically, investors who do not want to take the risk of allocation not happening through IPO will buy shares in the gray market and hope to flip the shares on listing to make a good profit.
Kostak rate is the amount an investor gets by selling his/her IPO application in grey market. This is the amount an investor stands to gain, irrespective of allotment status.
Subject to Sauda simply reflects the amount which an investor stands to get by selling his/her application for firm allotment. The key operative word here is firm allotment. In case of no allotment to the applicant, the sauda stands cancelled.

Secondary market - transaction b/w investor and stock exchange - issuer company is not involved

GDP and Economy is bound to increase so do Stock Market Valuation.
Why? increase in GDP is bcoz of increase in spending(demand) and production(supply)
supply/production increase=> revenue and profits increase=>share price increases
Inflation is bound to happen ,hence money value decreases over time or in other words rupee value decreases
Real Growth = current growth - inflation
Tax can be a burden - include tax saving instruments
GDP growth is guaranteed to be minimum 14%(8% actual growth + 6% inflation)

**Rescuers who makes sure GDP increases :
RBI reduces interest rate and keeps inflation in check @ 4-6% per year
GOVT reduces tax 

**Rescuers who makes sure GDP and stock markets are in sync :
STOCK EXCHANGES - shuffles the company ranks and their weightage in index
SEBI - regulates the markets and market participants, hence protecting investors

**Bank Facts:
Even the Money which we put in banks also goes to companies and if they don’t perform even bank can’t give u return
so instead of putting banks in the middle and giving them our share we deal with companies directly

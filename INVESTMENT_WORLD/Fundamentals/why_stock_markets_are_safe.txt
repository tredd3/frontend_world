GDP and Economy is bound to increase so do Stock Market Valuation.
Why? increase in GDP is bcoz of increase in spending(demand) and production(supply)
supply/production increase=> revenue and profits increase=>share price increases
Inflation is bound to happen ,hence money value decreases over time or in other words rupee value decreases
Real Growth = current growth - inflation
Tax can be a burden - include tax saving instruments
GDP growth is guaranteed to be minimum 14%(8% actual growth + 6% inflation)

*** affect of inflation ***
2 types of inflation:
1)demand pull: production capacity remains the same
e.g: property prices increase becuase every one has wealth and wants to buy the property
2)cost push : demand remains the same, but production cost increases
e.g: raw material cost/fuel cost increases, final product cost increases
*interest rates and inflation goes hand in hand
inflation is up => RBI generally increases interest rates to attract investments in Bonds/FDs=> expectations from stock market increases
if expectations are not reached => people remove money from stocks and invest in risk free returns => stock market can crash as well
inflation is down => RBI decreases interest rates => people invest in stock market and create bubble and markets PE becomes high 
*US increase interest rates => FIIs will remove money from indian markets and invest in US bonds => stock market will crash
*impact of inflation on markets:
positive: profits increase
negative: 

**Rescuers who makes sure GDP increases :
RBI reduces interest rate and keeps inflation in check @ 4-6% per year
GOVT reduces tax 

**Rescuers who makes sure GDP and stock markets are in sync :
STOCK EXCHANGES - shuffles the company ranks and their weightage in index
SEBI - regulates the markets and market participants, hence protecting investors

**Bank Facts:
Even the Money which we put in banks also goes to companies and if they don’t perform even bank can’t give u return
so instead of putting banks in the middle and giving them our share we deal with companies directly

Is demand in india sure to rise? YES
Market Price is related to demand and supply, which ultimately is decided by public, their lifestyle, income etc
scope of Indian public demand is very high given India is one of the poorest countries and has youngest population

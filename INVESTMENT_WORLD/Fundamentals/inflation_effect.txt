**** SUMMARY ****
inflation is temporary
inflation and interest rates are directly proportional, i.e if inflation rises interest rates will also rise
inflation => less real returns on fixed deposits, bonds etc
Cyclical stocks does well - they are at peak better to exit
companies with pricing power does well
real estate, rents ,gold and land prices will rise
equity returns can beat the inflation
consider investing in REITs => as they invest in commercial properties


*** affect of inflation ***
2 types of inflation:
1)demand pull: production capacity remains the same
e.g: property prices increase becuase every one has wealth and wants to buy the property
2)cost push : demand remains the same, but production cost increases
e.g: raw material cost/fuel cost increases, final product cost increases => companies can take a hit on balance sheet or they
can pass the price to customer


**** interest rates and inflation goes hand in hand *****
inflation is up => RBI generally increases interest rates (BULL MARKET) => stock market earnings goes down or there is a high 
expectations and if that is not met => people remove money from stocks and invest in risk free returns (Bonds/FDs) => stock
 market can crash as well
*e.g: US increase interest rates => FIIs will remove money from indian markets and invest in US bonds => stock market will crash
inflation is down => RBI decreases interest rates => (BULL MARKET) people invest in stock market and create bubble and markets PE becomes high 


***** impact of inflation on economy ******
RBI increases interest rates to get inflation under control
company profits take a hit
public/corporate spending decreases bcoz of costlier loans

//How Economy works

Economy is defined by an AREA, where some ACTIVITY happens, caused by the involvement of AGENTS.
AREA: india/any country/global
ACTIVITY:
* Production of “goods and services“.
* Distribution of goods and services.
* Trade of goods and services.
* Consumption of goods and service.
AGENTS: People who are involved in the above four activities
* Government
* Business
* People (individuals)

Economy Size is decided by GDP value 
GDP is the market value of all goods and services produced within in a country in a specific financial year. Generally, 
the economies of all the countries are expressed in USD for comparison.
US GDP 2020: 20 trillion$
India GDP 2020: 2 trillion$

Things necessary for an Economic activity:
*  Demand (Buyer)
* buyer should have money(buying power) and is willing to spend
“economic stimulus” - stimulating the buyers (government, business, individuals) to start spending money. 
In modern economy, if people are not spending, GDP cannot grow, other people will not earn money.
* Product (Seller).
* Confluence of buyer and seller in a place (There is a Market).
Transaction:In exchange for money, the seller gives the possession good (or renders a service) to the buyer.
If India is the big market, following are its sub-markets:
* NSE/BSE – stock market.
* Steel Market.
* Cement Market.
* Housing Market.
* Auto Market.
* Fuel market.
* Food Market.
* Clothing Market.
* Furniture Market etc.
In all these markets, transaction keep happening. You can imagine in a big country like India how many transactions might be 
happening in a matter of few minutes.
All these transactions (between buyer and seller) shapes the GDP of India.

Our economy works in cycles.The cycles effects everybody, be it government, business, or individuals.
government - finds GDP, interest rates, employment going up and down.
business - struggles to manage its sales, expenditure, profits in times of slower economic growth.
Individuals  - when economy is growing as expected, salary increments seems to happen with ease. But in times of recession, 
leave asides salary increments, the threat of job loss looms around.

Why the world’s economy seems to be looming in cycles? - Due to Debt

CYCLES of economy:
1)Short Term Debt Cycle: 6-8 yrs (due to cheap debt)
Within one short term debt cycle, there are two constituents (phases):
* Expansion (GDP growth rate positive) - less interest rates
=> People (individuals, business, government) take more debt in this phase
=> spending as Capital for a person(income + debt) increases 
=> income for others + debt taken by others 
=> spending and so on… leading to positive GDP growth
Too much spending => demand > supply => high inflation (peak of a short term debt cycle)
Is  high inflation bad?
Not always. But “excess credit” supported inflation is bad.
When people get easy debt, they will not work harder and productivity decreases.
Also since debt is cheap everyone takes more debt and more spending(more demand) while supply doesn’t grow at same pace and
 businesses increase price leading to inflation.
Income growth will happen only from productivity improvement. People must work hard to earn more money. But debt growth happens
almost automatically. Debt increases @ interest%.
PS: There must always be a balance between income growth and debt growth in an economy.

* Recession (GDP growth rate negative):
When inflation increases RBI increase interest rates 
=> debt becomes costly 
=> less loans taken and hence less spending 
=> less income for others
=> less spending so on….economy slows down(reverses the growth cycle)

2)Long Term Debt Cycle: 60-65 yrs (due to excess debt accumulation in economy)
Reason for debt accumulation: As debt is cheap people take new debts instead of clearing their older debts first, also  GDP 
growth needs spending. But GDP need not always grow at a staggering pace. GDP growing at an average rate of 5-7% for next 15-20 years 
is a dam good performance.
Peak of a long term debt cycle: high debt accumulation 
=> Interest levels are already rock bottom But people are still not opting for new debt bcoz they have to pay for existing debt,
also People are proactively cutting their expenses (to pay debt)
=> less spending meaning low income for others
=> other people will also default on loan repayment
=> again loss of income for someone else and so on…. 
=> economy starts to collapse
What follows the peak of “long term debt cycle” is Economic Depression.
 In last 100 years, the world has seen two such rampant economic debacles (depression).
One was in 1927 (The Great Depression), and in 2008 (USA Debt Crisis).
* Recession can last for 5-6 months.
* Depression can last for 2-3 years at a stretch.
Reflation: it is the phase where economy comes out from depression. It takes almost 10yrs
Since people have less money all the goods will now be traded for lesser price for people to sustain and fulfil their needs 
=> deflation prices of all the assets/goods go down 
PS: Deflation is hazardous for business and economy as a whole. Controlled inflation (neither high not too low) is what is best for any economy.
In fact Reflation is worse than depression, because economy wants to grow, but nobody is ready to spend.
Individuals - can’t spend bcoz income is less and also need to pay for debt
Businesses - can spend but income of people is less hence no demand, also since prices are less they will make loss, hence they won’t
Government - has to be the saviour
RBI brings in  inflation  by prints money and hands over this money to the government by purchasing government bonds. 
Government in turn use this money to stimulate spending in the economy. How?
* They start buying assets. Hence asset price begins to rise.
* As asset price rises, people start to feel wealthy.
* Value of collateral rise, and people become more credit worthy.
* Lenders begin to offer credit (debt).
* People take loans and start spending.
* Income of other begin to rise.
* Credit worthiness of population rise further.
* Hence more people resort to debt, means more spending.
* GDP growth rate starts becoming positive.

Exception : USD 
Why post 2008 crisis USD value increased?
US was also printing USD’s to boost spending and GDP growth. As a result USD valuation should have drastically fallen. 
But on the contrary USD got stronger post 2008 crisis. Why? Because USD is a major portion of foreign exchange reserves of 
many countries. If value of USD will go down, it will destroy the world economy. Hence during any crisis situation, 
countries tend to hoard more USD. This is done both to prevent the value of their “reserves”, and also to keep USD’s valuation stable.

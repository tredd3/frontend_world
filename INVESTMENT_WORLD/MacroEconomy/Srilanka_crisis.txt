//Reasons
1)zero real GDP growth rate (since people have no money there is no spending and hence no demand => which means there will be no supply 
   as people won't work hard to produce goods/service because of zero demand)
   i)organic-farming experiment that went wrong - fertilisers were banned rice production went down by 50%, so Srilank was forced 
     to import rice and reserves were used for this
   ii)Tourism revenue was zero because of COVID - Srilanka is heavily dependent on Tourism , as it contributes roughly 13% of GDP
2)current account deficit at record highs (lack of reserves)
  Current account deficit occurs when the value of goods and services a  country imports exceeds the value it exports.
  lack of forex reserves - zero tourism reveues and no remittance due to COVID
3)Fiscal deficit  at record highs (govt spending > revenue) hence Srilankan govt took debt to fund fiscal deficit
    tax cuts during pandemic - both personal and corporate
    expenses = distributing free money to people during COVID and they have spent it - instead of investing/creating value
    Taking Debt is good provided u spend on infrastructure , industries creation, training people , sourcing raw materials 
      But the problem it used the debt for spending and not on capital expenditure hence the debt money is exhausted now they
      took more debt and kept spending more on expenses(becuase of high Inflation) - this kept n repeating and they are in trap

Summary: COVID acted like a catalyst to the disastrous decisions made by The Govt

Result:
ZERO foreign reserves
Srilankan currency crashed by 40%, stock market crashed by 70% because the economy crashed
debt/GDP sky rocketted = 115%
tax revenues decreased to a larger extent - from 11.6% of GDP in 2019 to 8.1% in 2020 
default on its overseas bonds, bilateral credits, and all foreign currency-denominated loan agreements.
very high inflation (30%)
No international bank is ready to help


Future:
Help fron China , India
IMF bailout package - meaning it does provide money but it will ask the govt to enforce certain changes that will bounce back 
   the economy - increased tax rate, no subsidies, cutting deficits, opening doors for trade and liberalization.

organic-farming experiment that went wrong
zero real GDP growth rate (since people have no money there is no spending and hence no demand => which means there will be no supply 
   as people won't work hard to produce goods/service because of zero demand)
   tourism revenues - went down to almost zero due to COVID
current account deficit at record highs (lack of reserves)
  Current account deficit occurs when the value of goods and services a country imports exceeds the value it exports.
  lack of forex reserves meant that there was a severe shortage of many of the imported items such as fuel and food.
Fiscal deficit  at record highs (govt spending > revenue) hence Srilankan govt took debt to fund fiscal deficit
    tax cuts during pandemic - both personal and corporate
    expenses = distributing free money to people during COVID and they have spent it - instead of investing/creating value
    Taking Debt is good provided u spend on infrastructure , industries creation, training people , sourcing raw materials 
      But the problem it used the debt for spending and not on capital expenditure hence the debt money is exhausted and they
      are in trap 


Result:
Srilankan currency crashed by 40%, stock market crashed by 50% because the economy crashed
debt/GDP sky rocketted = 115%
tax revenues decreased to a larger extent - from 11.6% of GDP in 2019 to 8.1% in 2020 
default on its overseas bonds, bilateral credits, and all foreign currency-denominated loan agreements.
very high inflation


Future:
Help fron China , India
IMF bailout package - meaning it does provide money but it will ask the govt to enforce certain changes that will bounce back 
   the economy - increased tax rate, no subsidies, cutting deficits, opening doors for trade and liberalization.

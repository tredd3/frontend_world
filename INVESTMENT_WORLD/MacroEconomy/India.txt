//salary for people

//household wealth

Acc to RBI this is unsustainable and the assets keep shifting to financial assets

//Investment thesis of betting on Indian economy:
  cheap labour : low wages compared to global average in all sectors
  most of the people in india are young and lot if innovation is happening - super incentives for startups in india
  when people workhard , earn more and keep coming to  bucket 1 from bucket 2 , they will have more spending power and as 
  they improve their lifestyle they keep spending on things that are essential to them
  they  also invest gradually - affluent people do this a lot
  Also india wants to be self reliant - atam nirbhar bharat
  lot of schemes and incentives by govt
  In this journey a lot of money can be made -  just that u need to have patience and invest in the best business possible

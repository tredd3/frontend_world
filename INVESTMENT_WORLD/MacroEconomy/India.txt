//Macroeconomy Trends
digitisation - reduce time taken and money of people
physical to financial assets
lending - 43% indians still opt for informal lending paying high interest rates
atmanirbhar bharat - self reliance by local manufacturing to build resilient supply chain
   and import substitution 
rural to urban area migration in search of Jobs - housing demand in urban areas, PMAY (scheme where eligible people get home 
  loan at subsidised rates, rest born by central and state govt) 
push towards affordable housing by Govt in both Rural & Urban areas - low income people spending most of their income on house
govt pushing towards gas and solar usage - from coal based
push towards EVs by Govt - but cost, infra and stability issues
logistics investments + govt push - but there are road and other infra issues 
people are preferring SUVs to sedan/hatchback cars
manufacturing investments due to China+1 - diversification in supply and secure supply chain
manufacturing investments due to Europe+1 - Russian cheap gas is not used by Europe bcoz of NATO sanctions
increase in per capita income - leading people to prefer quality and brand => organised players capturing market share from unorganised
because of COVID , most of the unorganised players have been wiped out due to lack of pricing power, poor balance sheets -> helping
  organised players capturing market share from unorganised
JVs for electronic manufacturing with not just companies in China, but also with those from South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam - this 
   is a win-win for both China & India, bcoz semiconductor exports are banned to China from the US , now US semiconductor firms 
   can divert them to india and make in india

------------- FINANCIAL --------------
GDP : 2.26 trillion dollars (1/7 thof the US and 1/5th of china)
per capita GDP : 1900 USD, 6500 PPP terms (US has 10X times)
debt/GDP = 73% (US 200%)

//real estate
towns and cities : 8,000
villages : 649,481
urban population : 30%
Rural population : 70%

//salary for people
bucket1: 30cr - annual salary > 1lakh
bucket2: 100cr - annual salary < 1lakh

//household wealth
financial assets : 5% (10 trillion dollars)
physical assets: 95%

//corporate / business
tax rate : 25%


Acc to RBI this is unsustainable and the assets keep shifting to financial assets

//Investment thesis of betting on Indian economy:
  cheap labour : low wages compared to global average in all sectors
  most of the people in india are young and lot if innovation is happening - super incentives for startups in india
  when people workhard , earn more and keep coming to  bucket 1 from bucket 2 , they will have more spending power and as 
  they improve their lifestyle they keep spending on things that are essential to them
  they  also invest gradually - affluent people do this a lot
  Also india wants to be self reliant - atam nirbhar bharat
  lot of schemes and incentives by govt
  In this journey a lot of money can be made -  just that u need to have patience and invest in the best business possible


//Manufacturing sector growth at 5X in next 8 years
Meaning the companies which are extremely strong will grow at even higer growth rates
---Why was it a laggard till now?
Cyclical in nature
Unnecessary capacity expansion
huge Debt taken by corporates
policy issues
Bank refuse to lend loans due to d assets
---why will it go up?
Govt push - PLI, tax reduction
multiple growth triggers - China+1, Europe crisis, policy to boost Exports from India
Industry consolidation - due to Covid , giving the big players margin expansion as the compettion got eliminated and growth as they
    capture their market share
General confidence of foregn investors, promoters of the company etc
Improving Capacity utilisation
---Concerns
Inflation - consumer spending goes down
Commodity prices increase - companies margins might take a hit (although companies with pricing power can pass it on)
Recession in US & Europe - export opputunities might get hampered
Interest rate increase - bank lending might go down as public, companies won't take loans


//What to look for
Like banks this is a segment where management plays an important role
Invest in top 2-3 players - if you invest in bottom players they will get cleaned up during events like COVID, Recession etc
Balance sheet is very important , especially working capital - else they might become bankrupt
Multiple levers - should not focus on companies with one particular growth lever
Sell decision is very important
PE works in a opposite manner in this sector - High PE buy , low PE sell
Companies with Global parentage has an advantage of the parent technology

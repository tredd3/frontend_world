----------------------------- CHINA ----------------------------- 
china population is 140cr: 4X times US 
GDP : 15 trillion dollars
per capita GDP : 10,000 USD
//Investment thesis of betting on chinese economy:
  it is the only country in the world which bought most number of people from poverty in less time
  it cannot go against tech : it will kill innovation in china and it has to depend on other 
  countries for imports weakening theor economy and currency
  it cannot go against capital markets: global investors will lose confidence on the economy and leadership
  Also their quest for power and dominace in the world markets will always drive chinese leadership to be favoutable to businesses
    which will make them self reliant, give them more control over world commerce/trade in the form of exports to other nations
//chinese tech crack down


//Chinese Real estate and the Rich
10% population control 70% wealth
They became rich of real estate
Real estate prices kept on increasing bcoz of lot of reselling - fd returns are less, stock market returns are constant hence real 
  estate is the only option to make money for chinese citizens
COVID impacted real estate sector to suppy chain disruption of building materials and hence builders are not able to give posession
  but the citizens need to pay EMI. Hence defaulting started and banks are not able to recover those loans bcoz there is no 
  building exist or even if it exist the market price is very less

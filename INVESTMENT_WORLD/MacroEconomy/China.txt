----------------------------- CHINA ----------------------------- 
china population is 140cr: 4X times US 
GDP : 15 trillion dollars
per capita GDP : 10,000 USD
//Investment thesis of betting on chinese economy:
  it is the only country in the world which bought most number of people from poverty in less time
  it cannot go against tech : it will kill innovation in china and it has to depend on other 
  countries for imports weakening theor economy and currency
  it cannot go against capital markets: global investors will lose confidence on the economy and leadership
  Also their quest for power and dominace in the world markets will always drive chinese leadership to be favoutable to businesses
    which will make them self reliant, give them more control over world commerce/trade in the form of exports to other nations
//chinese tech crack down

----------------------------- CHINA ----------------------------- 
china population is 140cr: 4X times US 
GDP : 15 trillion dollars (1/3 rd is real estate production)
10% chinese work force worked in construction sector
China gives land lease up to 99yrs and that formed 1/3rd fiscal revenue for the govt
per capita GDP : 10,000 USD 

//Investment thesis of betting on chinese economy:
  it is the only country in the world which bought most number of people from poverty in less time
  it cannot go against tech : it will kill innovation in china and it has to depend on other 
  countries for imports weakening theor economy and currency
  it cannot go against capital markets: global investors will lose confidence on the economy and leadership
  Also their quest for power and dominace in the world markets will always drive chinese leadership to be favoutable to businesses
    which will make them self reliant, give them more control over world commerce/trade in the form of exports to other nations

//chinese tech crack down
to reduce monopoly and low wages chinese govt stepped in and regulated the tech sector leading to its downfall

//Chinese Real estate and the Rich
10% population control 70% wealth
They became rich of real estate
Real estate prices kept on increasing bcoz of lot of reselling - fd returns are less, stock market returns are constant hence real 
  estate is the only option to make money for chinese citizens
COVID impacted real estate sector to suppy chain disruption of building materials and hence builders are not able to give posession
  but the citizens need to pay EMI. Hence defaulting started and banks are not able to recover those loans bcoz there is no 
  building exist or even if it exist the market price is very less

//Evergrande crisis
before 1998 every citizen got a  flat for free from the govt
people living in govt appartments were allowed to buy the paartment at a very low cost
Rapid urbanisation:
  since farmers were earning almost the same wage since 1000 yrs, their sons and daughters flew to city to work in factories
  people need to live in appartments and evergrand took the oppurtunity to build it
  chinese banks gave loans to builders to build the stuff
  from 2004 to 2020 - evergrande revenue grew at a CAGR of 44%
  the promoter also became the richest man in china
  he made connections politically to get more debt and land because real estate developers need to buy land from local govt
Start of issue:
  homebuyers need to make an advance payment, but these funds are allocated to other areas hence stalling the projects
  chinese urban population growth dropped from 4% to 2%, i.e the demand for properties in urban areas for migrant workers is down 
  significantly - but the new appartments are built quite quickly neglecting this data point , i.e the rate of growth of new properties 
    is greater than rate of urban population growth leading to demand supply crunch
  Hence there are enough empty houses in China - which can fit the entire population of UK or Germany  
  On top of it the housing affordability in China is the worst in the world, it would take 50yrs of median household income to buy an
   appartment.
  worsening situation : leading to bankruptcy 
  half of china's developers crossed the red lines , which blocked them access to credit from banks, bonds etc  
  also govt asked banks to slow down mortgage loans - meaning evergrande can't sell appartments and they can't take more debt so 
  they can't pay their existing debt  
  if not restructured it can be biggest bankruptcy in the world history - as evergrande debt is 2% of China's GDP

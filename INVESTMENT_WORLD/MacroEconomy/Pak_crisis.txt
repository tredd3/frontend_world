//Reasons
1)political unstability - Military taking charge of the Govt without even holding full term
2)Terrorism:
UUSR wanted to capture Afghanistan - hence US, pak came up with terrorism and US funded them by giving money and resources 
  and made these terrorists fight with Russia.
  but the problem is they didn't stop after that.
  one such militant group is Talibans (who captured Afghanistan) started attacking pak  bcoz of 2 reasons:
   1)fencing between Pak and Afghanistan - disallowing Talibans to hideout in pak after attacking US Army
   2)TTP Talibans - creating their own force
3)Heavy debt and use of debt to fund Army
   usually debt is used to fund healthcare and Infra to make economy progress
4)Geography - was affected by floods last time but didn't take care of avoiding them in the future

//Result:
debt trap - 13 bailouts from IMF
inflation 25%
heavy infra loss due to floods - as no precaution was taken

//Future:
ZERO

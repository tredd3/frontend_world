------------------------------ Management ----------------------------
Promoter check: 
  if promoter is old, sucession plan is important
  history and passion is also important
  promoter pledging - know how much is pledged and the reason for pleding - if more shares are pledged company can go out of hand
FOCUS: should be on growth and shareholders instead of personal profits
-compnesation: variable based on permonance or fixed ? compnesation of the management in the low times should be less compared to high times 
  remuneration acc to MCA limits: 
  - type of stock options :ESOP(not recorded as an expense even though it is)/RSU(preferred as it is recorded an expense)
  Note: make sure to check outstanding shares growth YOY. any company issuing ESOPs abnormally and having a YOY outstanding shares 
  increase > 10%, doesn't care about shareholders
  -if the total outstanding shares are increasing YOY then check if EPS is growing or not (in the same rate or higher than EPS increase)
- does the executives hold any stocks? if yes then that motivates them to act in favour of shareholders
- related party transactions: should only be for business purposes(subsidary, JVs etc) and not to executives family or someother unrelated business
-Board of directors filled with management family members?
if yes then there is no one to question the management and put the compnay on a winning track
Note: board of directors is a group of individuals elected to represent shareholders and can question and fire the management
- involved in scams/cases: 
- CFO /auditor recently resigned/ continously resigning: 
- spoke about share price instead of business in news/annual reports/conf calls: 
- management should do what they say. did they do so? to be found in annual reports(letter to shareholders) & conference calls
-management should be completely transparent to its shareholders, "we don't disclose" is not what we want to hear 
Note: should admit the mistakes honestly and take responsibility for their actions
** skill test:
- skills relevant to industry: yes
- experience over > 10 yrs : yes (more experience means managers seen boom and burst and knows how to behave in each situation) 
- mindset/vision: growth via rural penetration/global foot print and value addition to customers
- how are reserves used - bank balance/M&A/dividends/buyback/reinvesting in own business/investing in other DCA companies
if dividends are paid - shareholders need to pay tax on it
so better to invest on other DCA businesses or even better is to buyback shares from extra cash as this financial engineering
concept increases shareholders wealth without paying any tax.
Note: buying back shares at a premium valuation is not the best use of capital, buying back is useful only if the 
shares are bought at lower/fairprices.

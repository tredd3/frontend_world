//overall requirements to be satisfied by a company
BUSINESS + FINANCIAL +  Management + VALUATION (all are equally important) + Margin of safety(for growth companies,
fair price for Value companies)
decision ONLY  based on facts(news, reports) and reasoning(think, compare), not on opinion and emotions
Provide Continuous fuel and efficiency to the process: keep updated with present knowledge
//why valuation are important?
if you buy an extraordinary company that is over valued, then it might take a decade for the earnings to catchup to the price
till then the stock price is not moving anywhere.
Which means the company will still make money , earnings will grow but your money won't grow, instead u could have kept the money in 
index funds/liquid debt funds


----------------------- PAST: company Background and Past performance ---------------------
---why did the promoters start business (family legacy/passion/strategic importance to other companies) - PASSION clearly wins

---Resources to know about the  company/business : 
1)wikipedia
2)company website - most important for updated info 
3)screener summary
4)crisil ratings scroll to the end of the page(about company, subsidaries, rating history)
5)company filings(investor presentation, conference calls and annual report(investments, debt sections)) from tijori

---what peter lynch bucket does stock belongs to?  check share price trend over the years you will get to know
1)slow growers(low risk, low returns)  - the only reason to hold should be dividends
2)stalwarts(low risk, moderate returns) - check if they can maintain the momentum and are getting in to diworsefications?
  companies acquiring market share from organised peers or unorganised peers
3)fast growers(high risk, high returns) :
  can they replicate the growth story somewhere else? e.g cam Matrimony replicate the startegy even in bangladesh(we need to monitor)
  what room is still left for growth?
  emerging tech companies
  companies in emerging industries
4)turnarounds(high risk, high returns)  - value unlocking via selling off the divisons that are less profitable/sell divisons in highly
  competettive industry OR increase the efficiency of the process/divisons by cost cutting and technology upgradation etc, which will
  translate them to low cost producer.
  value unlocking(highly profitable companies getting demerged from conglomerates e.g: ITC Infotech, ITC FMCG demerger from ITC group
  sleeping gaints awakened  - what road map does the company have from loss to profits (VI, IDFC FIRST BANK, TATA CONSUMER)
  ignored companies that have very strong growth potential in the future
Note: don't buy a turnaround just because stock price is down, own it if business is starting to pickup, financials are great etc
5)cyclicals(high risk, low returns or low risk high returns depending upon the cycle at which u have invested) - the more things 
  are stressed the better will be the recovery
  //Always prefer non cyclical or least cyclical
  cyclical + high fixed cost => DANGER as debt levels will be high, e.g: Airlines
  Note: Timing is everything in cyclicals
6)asset plays(low risk, high returns) - price vs value play (balance sheet scanning is must)
   hidden assets(like extrememly profitable subsidaries or divisons) like ITC
   natural resources like land, real estate,gold, oil or cash etc in high amounts? where the value of these exceeds the stock price
   patience is the key here because it might take years for wall street to discover these gems and re-rate the stock

Note: 
--companies keep shifting the buckets like fast growers can become slow growers or slow growers can become cyclicals
--cyclicals can become turarounds
--stalwarts like MCD can become asset plays bcoz of the real estate it owns
--growth expectation should not be the same for all the categories stocks alike

--------------------------------------- PRESENT ----------------------------------------
---Sectoral analysis:
//Sector value chain : from sourcing to sales entire process and businesses involved must be known (you should always pick companies 
at profitable end of value chain) demand and supply (size of opportunity)

---Products/services DEMAND check :
//product diversification - what all products company manufactures (you can find in investor presentation)
//where are the products used/what is the demand for those products?
    repeat businesses include subscripton models/continous and growing demand(solar,EV)/continous and constant demand(FMCG)
    if it is one time demand(capital goods) then growth oppurtunities size should be vast like Praj.Even though Praj establishes the ethanol plant,
     it has huge oppurtunity abroad/huge order backlog both domestic and abroad
//high margin non commoditized business? 
    if commoditized then must be a low cost producer
//if B2B (client diversification, strong order book)
//if B2C (are the products useful for each and every individual and have a strong demand)? bcoz strong demand => supply increases
 => revenue increases => EPS increases => share price increase => your money grows)
//if business service companies (almost every business should find its usage now or eventually)


---Products/services SUPPLY check :
check market share trend over the years in tijori - to know how much demand is being catered by the company 
Also to know if the company is losing the business to competetiors
Is there any peer whose market share is higher than the current company? - great check to find a excellent competetior business
what is the unorganised players market share?
imports risk from china or any other low cost producer country?
can company's business/products/services be replaced/substituted by new age technology/innovative products/services?
Competettion: 
  tijori(benchmark) and screener peer comparison sections for profitability and costs
  threat of new entrants


--- Products/services quality and value addition to customers check :
//does it delight the customers or own consumer minds (i.e people always remember this company when u talk about this product)? 
//Have u used the product/service ? 
  if YES, what is your view 
  if NO, go and open their website, check public review in ecommerce or google search
Note: if you are investing in this company only because of a specific product like chawyan prash(dabur), Royal enfield(Eicher) etc
always check wt % revenues are contributed by that product (for Eicher RE contributes around 90% revenues so it can be a buy based
 on further analysis but Dabur cannot be a buy based on chawayan prash because it contibutes < 10% to revenue)


--------------------------------------- FUTURE ----------------------------------------
---Process/Strategy check?
do you know market leader success and failures stories? if yes apply then to the current company process/strategy


--- Sustainabile Growth of Earnings check :
//competettive advantage/MOAT Check?
  check MOATS.txt
  if the company has a MOAT is it durable?
  if NO what is the 10 yr picture u have in ur mind? will it build one?
//monopoly or duopoly
//pricing power - are people ready to pay premium (can the compnay increase the product/services prices in the cases like inflation 
and supply chain disruption or in general and be sure that people still buy their products and they don't loose their business to 
competettion) proof: sales trend is upwards and Net profit Margin trend is either stable or upwards(tijori)
 This will happen only when they add value to the customers in terms of 
   i)quality of product/service OR
   ii)affordable price OR any other thing which their competetiors cannot give
//bargaining power of suppliers - if suppliers have the power it is pretty bad
//bargaining power of consumers - like e-commerce , this means company is in a highly competettive business
//Growth potential ?
Geographical diversification - globally present? if not does it have a deep rural reach?
 better to have both, which helps in risk Management and strong growth oppurtunities in emerging countries
 for a company with high global presence , global competettion, political and currency risk need to be monitored
** Multiple ways of Growth(Increasing Earnings): (find out which strategy out of the these will the company use)
- sell more products in older markets(acquire new customers - deeper penetration to areas like rural/untapped areas, takeaway market 
    share from competetiors in those areas)
- capex and manufacture new products(innovated products/refurbised products) and selling them to old customers at high prices
- simply increase the price of old products(no increase in volume) - stupid growth among all options
- expand in new markets(international expansion/ exports)
- cost cutting(cannot cut beyond a certain point)
- dispose losing operations (increases firm efficiency)
- acquistion and synergy led growth
- it is in a growing sector with tailwinds
- it is in a non growth/dull sector but company keeps growing by capturing market share from other organised/unorganised players

Note: Both Growth MOATS and Growth oppurtunities need to exist else earnings are not sustainable
Company with No Moats  but very high growth oppurtunities - a short term buy becuase other competetiors with MOATS can take away the
market share soon - need to monitor closely
company with good MOATS but not very good growth oppurtunities - it has become a slow grower(if you have lot of money u can invest
 here if not search for stalwarts or fast growers)


----------------------------------- Financial strength check -----------------------------
//debt free or almost debt free
//if there is debt then usage of Debt is Very important 
  GOOD Usage: sales growth/capex augumentation/one time capex upgradation/ acquisition purposes/new product launch/spending on 
  technology for achieving efficiency
  BAD Usage: expenses, continous capex upgradation
  

Note: financials always give you an idea of the company till now and the how is financial strength of the company at present,
 but you need to own the company because of its future prospects and decide whether these past finacials can improve or remian 
 sustainable or deteriorate depending on the above analysis

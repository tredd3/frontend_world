  if a share is falling: google search why a company share is falling - check news section in morning star/ticker tape
  Also check Stock_Crash.txt
  And also check promoter shareholding pattern trend in tijori
  Internal factors: then skip the company
  External factors: then proceed with screening
--check if the company is present in https://www.valueresearchstocks.com/recos-current - read the report if stock is present
--check DON'T_BUY.txt 
--check BUY_THESE.txt
--legal orders(confirm from wiki) and corporate actions especially buyback(tickertape)
--check shareholding pattern(especially promoter) trend over the years in tijori
  Institutional ownership: lower is the better because if the company performs well they keep buying it and share price takes off
--promoter pledging
--any recent insider buying (bse india > disclosures > insider trading) (Especially if normal employees are buying apart form 
  promoters/top management then its a positive sign as they know better than any broker/analyst/investor)

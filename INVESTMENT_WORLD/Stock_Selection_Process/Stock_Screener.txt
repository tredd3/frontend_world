//overall requirements to be satisfied by a company
BUSINESS + FINANCIAL +  Management + VALUATION (all are equally important) + Margin of safety(for growth companies,
fair price for Value companies)
//why valuation are important?
if you buy an extraordinary company that is over valued, then it might take a decade for the earnings to catchup to the price
till then the stock price is not moving anywhere.
Which means the company will still make money , earnings will grow but your money won't grow

Note: increase margin of safety is a must for companies which doesn't pass important filters


----------- FIRST set of companies - get them on undervaluation/fair valuation -------------------------
---------- company Background and Basic screening ---------
//CRISIL Rating must be Above A and check Rating History for last 3 Years(scroll down in crisil report)
//why did the promoters start business (family legacy/passion/strategic importance to other companies) - PASSION clearly wins
//check the share price in wiki (continously decreasing then check Stock_Crash.txt)
//check shareholding pattern and trend over the years in tijori
  Institutional ownership: lower is the better because if the company performs well they keep buying it and share price takes off
//non cyclical or least cyclical
cyclical + high fixed cost => DANGER as debt levels will be high, e.g: Airlines


----------- which category does the stock belong to ---------------
//why peter lynch bucket does stock belongs to?  check share price trend over the years you will get to know
1)slow growers(low risk, low returns)  - the only reason to hold should be dividends
2)stalwarts(low risk, moderate returns) - check if they can maintain the momentum and are getting in to diworsefications?
  companies acquiring market share from organised peers or unorganised peers
3)fast growers(high risk, high returns) :
  can they replicate the growth story somewhere else? e.g cam Matrimony replicate the startegy even in bangladesh(we need to monitor)
  what room is still left for growth?
  emerging tech companies
  companies in emerging industries
4)turnarounds(high risk, high returns)  - value unlocking via selling off the divisons that are less profitable/sell divisons in highly
  competettive industry OR increase the efficiency of the process/divisons by cost cutting and technology upgradation etc, which will
  translate them to low cost producer.
  value unlocking(highly profitable companies getting demerged from conglomerates e.g: ITC Infotech, ITC FMCG demerger from ITC group
  sleeping gaints awakened  - what road map does the company have from loss to profits (VI, IDFC FIRST BANK, TATA CONSUMER)
  ignored companies that have very strong growth potential in the future
Note: don't buy a turnaround just because stock price is down, own it if business is starting to pickup, financials are great etc
5)cyclicals(high risk, low returns or low risk high returns depending upon the cycle at which u have invested) - the more things 
  are stressed the better will be the recovery
6)asset plays(low risk, high returns) - price vs value play (balance sheet scanning is must)
   hidden assets(like extrememly profitable subsidaries or divisons) like ITC
   natural resources like land, real estate,gold, oil or cash etc in high amounts? where the value of these exceeds the stock price
   patience is the key here because it might take years for wall street to discover these gems and re-rate the stock

Note: 
--companies keep shifting the buckets like fast growers can become slow growers or slow growers can become cyclicals
--cyclicals can become turarounds
--stalwarts like MCD can become asset plays bcoz of the real estate it owns
--growth expectation should not be the same for all the categories stocks alike

------ Products/services demand and supply check --------
//product diversification
//where are the product used/what is the demand for the products?
    repeat businesses include subscripton models/continous and growing demand(solar,EV)/continous and constant demand(FMCG)
    if it is one time demand(capital goods) then growth oppurtunities size should be vast like Praj.Even though Praj establishes the ethanol plant,
     it has huge oppurtunity abroad/huge order backlog both domestic and abroad
//can company's business/products/services be replaced/substituted by new age technology/innovative products/services?
//high margin non commoditized business? 
    if commoditized then must be a low cost producer
//if B2B (client diversification, strong order book)
//if B2C (products must be useful for each and every individual and have a strong demand bcoz strong demand => supply increases(check 
market share to know how much demand is being catered) => revenue increases => EPS increases => share price increase => your money grows)
Is there any peer whose market share is higher than the current company?
compare the peers screener/BSE on the basis of (efficieny - NPM,OPM and  profitability - ROCE, ROE, ROIC)
//if business service companies (almost every business should find its usage now or eventually)


---------- Products/services quality and strength check ---------
//owns consumer minds (retail/business)? 
//Have u used the product/service ? 
  if YES, what is your view 
  if NO, go and open their website, check public review in ecommerce or google search
Note: if you are investing in this company only because of a specific product like chawyan prash(dabur), Royal enfield(Eicher) etc
always check wt % revenues are contributed by that product (for Eicher RE contributes around 90% revenues so it can be a buy based
 on further analysis but Dabur cannot be a buy based on chawayan prash because it contibutes < 10% to revenue)


----------- Sustainability -----------
//what is the competettive advantage/MOAT and does the company have one compared to its competetiors?
  if yes is it durable?
  if NO what is the 10 yr picture u have in ur mind? will it build one?
//entry barriers - bcoz the businesses are difficult to start/replace/maintain
  check market share trend over the years - to know if the company is losing the business to competetiors
//avoid companies with intense competettion (The intense competition could restrict company's revenue growth and it
 takes away its pricing power)
//monopoly or duopoly
//geographical diversification - globally present? if not does it have a deep rural reach?
 better to have both, which helps in risk Management and strong growth oppurtunities in emerging countries
 for a company with high global presence , global competettion, political and currency risk need to be monitored
//pricing power - are people ready to pay premium (can the compnay increase the product/services prices in the cases like inflation 
and supply chain disruption or in general and be sure that people still buy their products and they don't loose their business to 
competettion) proof: sales trend is upwards and Net profit Margin trend is either stable or upwards(tijori)
e.g: Airlines, E-commerce doesn't have pricing power
 This will happen only when they add value to the customers in terms of 
   i)quality of product/service OR
   ii)affordable price OR any other thing which their competetiors cannot give
//not dependent on/tightly linked to fortunes of a single client company/certain companies
//not dependent on govt lifting bans on imports, govt subsidies/schemes or order inflows only from 
  govt or limited clients or will get orders only on low bidding(here others can take over or it will
  put pressure on margins)


------------- Growth potential ---------
//High growth potential? - both vertically (nation wide including rural areas) and horizontally (internationally)
   avoid companies with limited market size - as the companies doesn't have an option to expand beyond a certain point
   e.g some companies market is limited to only domestic and that too only few businesses/clients need it
** Multiple ways of Growth(Increasing Earnings): (find out which strategy out of the these will the company use)
- sell more products in older markets(acquire new customers - expanding to other areas like rural/untapped areas, takeaway market 
    share from competetiors )
- capex and manufacture new products(innovated products/refurbised products) and selling them to old customers at high prices
- simply increase the price of old products(no increase in volume) - stupid growth among all options
- expand in new markets(international expansion/ exports)
- cost cutting
- dispose losing operations (increases firm efficiency)
- acquistion and synergy led growth


//Avoid companies that has grown only because of Acquisitions(like Zydus, Workday etc) because of the below reasons:
  i) company will not have that USP built in , it will not have any core philosophy and hence might not attract investors. 
  ii)Also the cost at which it is acquiring companies is very important. what if all the acquired companies work culture is 
    different ? there will not be any synergy rather it will be very complex for the management to handle putting the companies revenues and growth for a toss.
  iii)The acquired companies might not augument/bring in much value to existing operations
  iv)management will not have a mindset to fix the business model, rather always think of few more acquisitions to solve the
    all the problems mentioned.
However Having said all these there are few companies that can really make it work and keep acquiring to get ahead of the
  competettion or to eliminate the competettion and thrive as a major player

---------- Financial strength ----------
//debt free or almost debt free
Types of Debt:
1)Bank Type Debt: Non-convertible debentures and commercial papers(complete payment within a year) , bankOverdraft(on demand payment)
2)Funded Debt: Term loans, Non-convertible bonds and Convertible bonds(they are long term and payments can be made in installments
  over the years)
Note: any company having a lot of bank type debt is gone duing crisis(stock price will crash)
//should not require contionus investment on capex OR significant investment in R&D (for eg some pharma companies put >40% of
  revenues in R&D, if it succeeds then new revenue stream but if it fails then stock price will crash)
Usage of Debt: Very important 
  GOOD Usage: growth/capex augumentation/one time capex upgradation/ acquisition purposes/new product launch/spending on technology
   for achieving efficiency
  BAD Usage: expenses, continous capex upgradation
  
Types of Capex:
i)Capex Upgradation(very bad): Telecom,Automobile,Airlines companies need to do continous capex to upgrade their network equipments and infra etc
check net block(plant, equipment, machinery trend in balance sheet to check whether it is a upgradation capex or capex addition)
ii)Capacity augumentation(Good): most companies do capex to increase their capacity and service more demand which is fine
//operating expenses under control? this parameter indicates management efficiency 
    if high fixed costs business(then company should have operations of scale and high volumes else the company might be in debt)
    To confirm check operating expense as % of revenue
//strong financials for 10yrs - especially check their 5/10yr cash flow analysis in tijori and initial summary section in screener
however a company can have average finacials and has a high scope to improve
Note: financials always give you an idea of the company till now and the how is financial strength of the company at present,
 but you need to own the company because of its future prospects and decide whether these past finacials can improve or remian 
 sustainable or deteriorate depending on the above analysis

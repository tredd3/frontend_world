/////----------------------- Run way for Growth/oppurtunity to grow : small, large, huge -----------------------////
------------ sector/industry growth oppurtunity ------------
Note: avoid investing in highly regulated sectors, sectors linked significantly to commodity prices and sectors exposed to technological disruption.

sector growth rate: 

//demand
  /demand origin: B2B/ B2C/ Business Services/ Govt/ Global
  /Type of demand:
    continous and growing demand - volume led growth reaching to larger audience or more consumption(personal care, healthcare, 
       insurance, real estate, Energy,Banking and f inance, Investments)
    continous and replacement/upgradation demand based on latest trends/depreciation - value addition (clothing and footwear, 
        Electronics, Automobile,home furnishing)
    continous and constant/slow growth demand(FMCG, Food, Telecommunication) - volume growth and pricing power play
    one time demand(capital goods) then growth oppurtunities size should be vast like Praj.Even though Praj establishes the ethanol
     plant, it has huge oppurtunity abroad/huge order backlog both domestic and abroad
    Transition Demand - EV, Renewable Energy, 5G, New Technology - need a lot of research as it can make or break your portfolio
      bcoz of high competettion given the size of oppurtunity
  /demand/market size (present): large/small - essential product/service used by almost every human/business
    Note: if a company's market size is small even though it's a market leader it doesn't matter as it cannot be a multi bagger 
  /demand growth next 10 yrs: constant/medium/high (depends on type of demand)
    /low penetration - new customers in untapped and rural areas start consuming the product
    /high penetration - but oppurtunity of volume increase either via frequency of usage OR increase in consumption of units per person
    /import substitution (Atam nirbhar bharat)

------------ company specific growth oppurtunity ------------
/market share: 

/Pricing power implies people are willing to pay premium (can the company increase the product/services prices in the cases
 like inflation and supply chain disruption or in general and be sure that people still buy their products and they don't loose their 
 business to competettion)  - this helps company to sustain recession, inflation, supply chain disruption
 This will happen only when :
   i)The product or service is unique and there is hardly any substitute
   ii)NO bargaining power of suppliers: suppliers shouldn't have more bargaining power, if they have then better to own the supplier stocks
     Bargining power of suppliers(low or -ve accounts payable) - critical parts/services suppliers, ONLY producer/supplier of certain products
     Bargining power of company(-ve working capital) - bulk and recurring buy, company with MOATS (as the demand is sustainable)
    Note: Account payables is high meaning company having bargaining power
   iii)NO bargaining power of buyers :
     Bargaining power of buyers(higher inventory days as people always look for bargain in other places, high account recievables as
     the company needs to give the product on credit ) - if client base is limited then company doesn't have a choice but to sell 
     the products at a lower price, if the buyer demands so, especially true for B2B suppliers 
     OR if a company in a highly competettive business (e-commerce, airlines) where people never want to pay premium OR if the 
     product is a commodity (then people always look for low price as value is same across producers)
  Note: Pricing power is must for capex heavy companies(high fixed cost or operating leverage) companies with large amounts of
  debt - otherwise they can go Bankruptcy and destroy shareholder's wealth during recession.

/Competettive advantage/MOAT Check? check MOATS_check.txt
MOAT - is the trait or quality that a business has bcoz of which competettion cannot snatch away its earnings and customers
Note: do not invest in businesses whose moats are primarily driven by regulations and political linkages.
Economises of Scale
Low cost producer - check product quality and profitability ratios
Brand - must be accompained with pricing power
Taste
Network effect
Intangible assets
Switching costs
Entry barriers
Luxury/Premium Range
Monopoly/Duopoly(monopoly might not create wealth everytime be careful with these companies if a competettion comes in and 
   takes away the profit they will bust you However that doesn't happen overnight, it will be gradually reflected in the earnings
   so doing an annual review should catch these stuff)
   -if market size is less then the monopoly companies might face price heat from other smaller companies
   -All monopoly companies earnings growth rate == sector/industry growth rate (hence sector/industry analysis becomes extremely
    important)

/COMPETETION :  Never invest in a highly competettive industry that competes ONLY on price(price war) instead of value
  existing competetion - compare with the current company with peers in both business & financials
     use tijori(benchmark) and screener peer comparison sections for profitability and costs
     //what value does it add to customers compared to competetiors?
     //how is the quality of product/service - Have u used the product/service ? 
     if YES, what is your view 
     if NO, go and open their website, check public review in ecommerce or google search
  global competettion - imports risk from china or any other low cost producer country?
  threat of new entrants - check entry barriers in MOATS
Note: 
 if a business is extremely profitable then it attracts lot of capital , hence taking away gains/market share (so MOAT check is imp)
 if a business is dull/not profitable then lot of competettion goes away => current company that survives or control expenses will 
   keep gaining market share and eventually turns profitable (keep an eye)


//supply check:
  strong competetion and weak MOATS (small runway) - Avoid 
  strong competetion and strong MOATS (medium runway)  
  weak competettion (unorganised players) and strong MOATS (large runway)
  /snatch market share - Acquire customers from competetiors by taking away their market share (organised/unorganised players and 
    does capex to service the demand)

------------ Export growth oppurtunity ------------
china+1 or demand shift from other countries to India
Europe+1 - russia Ukrain War


////---------------------- Energy to run: is it generating enough cash and profitable enough ---------------------- ////
Note: if they can't generate enough cash (reserves), they must rely on debt/ new equity for growth

/strong balance sheet : weak/ medium/ strong
/5yr avg ROCE (ROCE must be greater than cost of capital):    
  /why Return on Capital is important?
  Over the longterm the investment returns will always resemble the capital returns
  /Good company: ROCE/ROIC(return on capital) > WACC (cost of cpital) and 
  either ROCE is increasing and capital is constant OR Capital is increasing and ROCE is constant
  /Ideal company : if it can redeploy the incremental capital for same/high returns over time - it becomes a compounding machine
  i.e both ROCE and capital is increasing


////---------------------- Capital allocation and management focus to capture the growth Oppurtunity ------------------//// 
//SOURCE OF CAPITAL - Debt/Retained Earnings/New Equity
//Use of Capital:
1)Growth
    /Global expansion/ exports - Launch products in new markets
    /capex - brownfield or greenfield
    /Launch New products 
    /Product mix change - increase the share of high margin products
    Note: mode of capex funding is also important: preference cash>debt>equity
    /Acquistion and synergy led growth(Acquistion for strategic purpose(augumenting existing business like acquiring firm that supplies
    key raw materials, firm that has excellent technology and skilled manpower, firm that has reputation globally and is present in 
    areas where the current firm doesn't OR in simple words acquire any firm that adds value by doing something which the current 
    firm doesn't OR any firm that increases the efficieny of the current firm operations) 
2)Efficiency 
    /promoter OR management change
    /working capital cycle reduction
    /spending on technology for achieving efficiency and modernising the workflow or processes
    /spin off - dispose losing operations (increases firm efficiency by increasing management focus)
    /cost reduction: check OPM trend
      1)raw material cost reduction - backward integration or bulk purchase (check GPM trend)
      2)logistics cost reduction - putting plants near customer/raw material locations
      3)process optimisation and innovation - chemicals and pharma mainly
      4)Reduce debt - look at D/E trend over 10yrs and Debt/Profit should be less than 5
      NOTE: This form of growth will increase profitability of the firm in the short term, but a company cannot become efficient 
      after a certain point(even though it can maintain that efficiency) hence for the profitability to sustain in the longterm this
      needs to be augumented by Demand/consumption led growth either from New or Old customers(Preferably from new customers)
      But in the journey of company becoming efficient you can make huge profits and hence always check whether management is focusing
      on making the firm efficient or not apart from focusing on sales
3)MOAT building - they save taxes in short term and create wealth in the longterm
    /vertical integration - zero dependence on others, high avialbility, cost advantage and quality control e.g: Apple, Amazon
    /backward or forward integration  
    /R&D - for future business but the amount spent has to be monitored
    /Advertising - brand building and awareness activity but the amount spent has to be monitored, along with sales growth
    /Increase distribution network
    Note : check expenses breakup and see which expenses are growing YOY
4)Return to Shareholders:
    Dividends - most mature companies give out dividends as they don't find better oppurtunities to re-invest profits
    Buyback - preferred
    Bonus issues
5)Bad ways:
    finance losses
    manintenance capex
    related parted transaction - to promoter owned firms for irrelevant purposes, family members


// SUMMARY (Business Quality Check) - decided by PAST, PRESENT and FUTURE of the company
  -Ideal business: Yes/No
   always takes little amount of capital to operate and an excellent business always earns same high returns on incremental capital

   POSITIVES:
  -Superior economics (what does company produce, target audience and how does it produce): ESG Principles
   Environmental: does the process/products cause any kind of pollution
   Social: does the products/services add some value to customers or do they waste their time or money or destroy their health
   Governance: Superior Management and board of directors
  -Predictable and consistent EARNINGS for next 10 yrs(sticky and recurring)
  -Repeat business - people need to keep buying it to survive/daily needs 
  -Platform/Infrastucture Business(Indiamart, IEX, Amazon, Delhivery) - (MOAT: Economies of scale, Switching cost, Distribution network)
  -Competes on value rather than price bcoz company that competes on value is like a magnet with stronger magnetic field  that
    attracts customers and companies which compete on price will lose their business to competetiors
  -recession proof ? how did it perform in 2008 and 2020 crisis
    Note : high debt or high capex companies can go bust during recession or high inflatory situations(if no pricing power)
  -Scalable business model - globally preferred (mutibagger are made because of this property)
  -proxy play on some industry ? 
  -Lousy industriy Survivor: operating in boring/lousy industries where no one wants to enter or companies in that sector
   facing heavy loses and low profitability or no growth, hence the Survivor
  -niche/extreme niche - does something very specific which takes a lot of time to build (MOAT: entry barriers, switching cost)
  -deals with very sensitive sectors needing lot of approvals and gain client trust/confidence
  -Having Tailwinds is an added advantage as it boosts the process of wealth creation and helps u in achieving goal faster

  NEGATIVES:
  -dependent on govt OR Linked to Govt: Price controlled by Govt, Govt is the only Customer , Anti-dumping duty by Govt
  -non Predictable for next 5-10yrs
  -competes only on Price with very little value addition and attract via discounts like Food delivery, Paytm , Nykaa
  -not recession proof
  -commoditized business - if commoditized the it must be a low cost producer
  -cyclical - cyclical revenues and cashflows
  -highly competettive industry like Auto/Telecom/Aviation etc
  -Non scalable business Either bcoz of limited market size OR Global competettion
  -limited clients - Zero pricing power
  -CONTINOUSLY needs to add and upgrade capex to stay in business like infra comapnies (telecom, energy, airlines, utilities)
  -CONTINOUSLY needs to spend more money on R&D to stay in business like electronics, auto and pharma companies that spend heavily on R&D
  -If a person has lot of money he can break ur business and take away marketshare
  -diworsefication - enetering in to businesses or acquiring businesses that doesn't belong to the expertise level of the current 
  company 
  -Avoid serial Acquirers
  -B2B player that doesn't have pricing power because of high competettion, commoditised or no MOATs
  -lower end of value chain

what happens if any of the risks play out? will it impact the business in a big way

---Business Risk:

---Financial Risk:

---Management Risk:

---Investment Returns Risk:


////----------------------------------- Valuation ----------------------------------------////
Note: Valuation is what differentiates Great Investment from a great business
 -- Price is different Valuation is different, just bcoz stock is falling doesn't mean it is cheap(earnings might be falling too)
 -- Price is what people pay for the business, Valuation is price compared to earnings 
 -- Don't invest in a stock because the price has fallen and you think the price will increase , own the stock because you 
  understand that business(circle of competence) , believe in its future(i.e predictability and earning power) and it 
  is available at lower valuations (absolute(DCF) and relative, with more focus on absolute)
 -- can you put 50% of your net worth, buy the whole business and forget about it for next 5-10 yrs ???
   assuming that stock market is closed for next 5-10yrs are you ok holding the entire business without knowing its price every year?
  for longterm : don't invest in a stock just bcoz the stock price will increase, invest because you want to own that business

--EV/OCF(Market cap + debt - cash&cash equivalents)/Operating cash flow
--PEG: 
--DCF: check Tijori DCF valuation

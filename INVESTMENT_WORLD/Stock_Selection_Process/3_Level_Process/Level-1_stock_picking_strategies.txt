mutual funds portfolio: https://groww.in/mutual-funds/icici-prudential-technology-fund-direct-growth
instead get the idea behind the investment and apply for your investments

7)Contrarian: investing in stocks with low PE(investor sentiment)
Most of the investors overlook the oppurtunity and sell based on bad opinions but if you look at the facts , logic it tells 
a different story. Hence you grab the oppurtunity , invest and hold for longterm to create wealth
Note: the company fundamentals should be good with clean balance sheet and good growth oppurtunities, just that PE(sentiment)
 is negative


8)capacity to reinvest(most important) + capacity to suffer:
capacity to reinvest -  highly mature brand generating stable free cash flow and has almost closed the doors for growth
To open up the doors for growth and create further wealth company should have the capacity to suffer in other words MANAGEMENT 
  should have the guts to underwrite the development expenses(like advertising/brand building in other geographies, capex, creating
  infrastructure, R&D) wrt to operating profit, hence avoiding paying taxes.
Note: this concept involves using free cash flow generated by the mature business, taking high debt is not entertained, also R&D 
 spend should be in control.
E.g: This is applicable for FMCG companies that doesn't find any further growth oppurtunities in the country, to expand to other
  geographies

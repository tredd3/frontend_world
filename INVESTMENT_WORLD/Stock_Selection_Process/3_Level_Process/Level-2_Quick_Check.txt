******** Basic Screening of stocks *********
1)General
--stock picking strategy: check Level-1_stock_picking_strategies.txt
--Normal check on stock price since inception - google search (share price increasing or any abnormality observed)
  if a share is falling: google search why a company share is falling - check news section in morning star/ticker tape
  Also check Why_Stock_Price_Falling.txt
--check if the company is present in https://www.valueresearchstocks.com/recos-current - read the report if stock is present
--check DON'T_BUY.txt
--check BUY_THESE.txt
--legal orders(confirm from wiki) and tickertape
--corporate actions, dividend history and announcements from tickertape
--shareholder friendly actions like buyback or continous dividend payment?
--check shareholding pattern(especially promoter) trend over the years in tijori
  Institutional ownership: lower is the better because if the company performs well they keep buying it and share price takes off
--promoter pledging
--any recent insider buying (bse india > disclosures > insider trading) (Especially if normal employees are buying apart form 
  promoters/top management then its a positive sign as they know better than any broker/analyst/investor)
--circle of competence? do you know this business, do you have an edge over others? if you don't then develop one
    Note: Never buy a business that you don't understand or difficult to understand even after reading it
--Never buy a business that changes too often that you can't predict it for the next 10 years


2)Business:
--Check Screener pros and cons
--what peter lynch bucket does stock belongs to?
Categories of Stock: 
1)slow growers(HUL,Dabur) - highly mature, revenue growth 1-5% inline with GDP growth or even lesser
2)stalwarts - 10-15% revenue growth (TataElixi, IEX)
3)Fast Growers (Praj)
4)cyclicals(Auto industry, Travel)

--CRISIL Rating must be Above A and check Rating History for last 3 Years(scroll down in crisil report)
--market share trend
--company must focus on value addition to its customers and not on price
--can a fool run this business - i.e business brand value and strength check
--can you put 25% of your net worth, buy the whole business and forget about it for next 5-10 yrs ???
  assuming that stock market is closed for next 5-10yrs are you ok holding the entire business without knowing its price every year?
--for longterm : don't invest in a stock just bcoz the stock price will increase, invest because you want to own that business


3)Financial Strength: Consistency check on 10yr financial data (standalone and consolidated)
//Balance sheet
--Total assets(current valuation) compared with Marketcap - to identify asset plays
--check current assets(mainly cash) compared to current liabilities - bcoz if current liabilities > current assets then u need to 
  sell non current-assets to clear them or take loan (both are bad)
--shareholder Equity growth should be due to retained earnings growth and not new common stock(check cashlow statement - financing 
  activity -- proceeds from shares section)
//Profit and loss statement
--sales growth consistent and increasing?
--operating profit +ve  most of the time and growing?
--other income significant to operating profit over the years?
--interest expense >40-50% of operating profit?
--net income consistently +ve and growing? 
//Cashflow statement
--CFO +ve most of the time and growing?
--free cash flow consistently +ve and growing?
Note: if free cash flow is -ve check why
free cash flow -ve bcoz of operating cash flow => company is bad and in-efficienct
free cash flow -ve bcoz of capex => is it doing continous capex(10 yr check cash flow analysis)
Also if other params are good and -ve free cash flow is bcoz of capex then you can invest 
--use of freecash flow: check 10yr cash flow analysis in tijori (preferrence is reinvestment)
company can have average finacials and has a high scope to improve
--outstanding shares increasing every year ? check cashflow from financing section
//Ratios:
--NPM(consistent and above 10%) - company has Pricing power 
--OPM(consistent and above 10%) - company has Efficient management 
--ROE consistent and  10-15% (with D/E under control)? ROE is the real return as this indicates that owners wealth is being compounded 
--ROCE(consistent and above 15%) - good profitability
--ROIC(consistent and above 15%) - company has MOATS
--D/E < 1?
if D/E > 0 check in the balance sheet if the long term debt is increasing ?
check D/E trend
can long term debt can be cleared by earnings of 4 yrs?(look at debt/Profit metrics in screener)


4)Valuation: 
Price is different Valuation is different, just bcoz stock is falling doesn't mean it is cheap(earnings might be falling too)
//find out how much time will it take to get ur money back? 
--EV/EBIT Valuation
--(Market cap - cash&cash equivalents)/Free cash flow Valuation
if free cashflow is irregular(avg free cash flow for 5 years)/if free cashflow is increasing consistently(free cash flow for last year)
time taken <= 15 : Undervalued,
time taken 15 - 20 : Fair value,
time taken >20 : company is Overvalued, better to invest in FD where u will get ur money back in 20yrs (assuming interest rates are 5%)

----------------------------- GLOBAL TRENDS ----------------------------- 
76% of global wealth is held by 10% population


----------------------------- INDIA ----------------------------- 
POPULATION: 130cr (roughly 4X times US)
GDP : 2.7 trillion dollars (1/7 thof the US and 1/5th of china)
//salary for people
bucket1: 30cr - annual salary > 1lakh
bucket2: 100cr - annual salary < 1lakh

//household wealth
financial assets : 5% (10 trillion dollars)
physical assets: 95%

Acc to RBI this is unsustainable and the assets keep shifting to financial assets

//Investment thesis of betting on Indian economy:
  cheap labour : low wages compared to global average in all sectors
  most of the people in india are young and lot if innovation is happening - super incentives for startups in india
  when people workhard , earn more and keep coming to  bucket 1 from bucket 2 , they will have more spending power and as 
  they improve their lifestyle they keep spending on things that are essential to them
  they  also invest gradually - affluent people do this a lot
  Also india wants to be self reliant - atam nirbhar bharat
  lot of schemes and incentives by govt
  In this journey a lot of money can be made -  just that u need to have patience and invest in the best business possible


----------------------------- CHINA ----------------------------- 
china population is 140cr: 4X times US 
GDP : 15 trillion dollars
//Investment thesis of betting on chinese economy:
  it is the only country in the world which bought most number of people from poverty in less time
  it cannot go against tech : it will kill innovation in china and it has to depend on other 
  countries for imports weakening theor economy and currency
  it cannot go against capital markets: global investors will lose confidence on the economy and leadership
  Also their quest for power and dominace in the world markets will always drive chinese leadership to be favoutable to businesses
    which will make them self reliant, give them more control over world commerce/trade in the form of exports to other nations


-----------------------------  US ----------------------------- 
US population is 33cr
GDP : 15 trillion dollars
bucket 1: 20cr - affluent people
country with strongest currency and highest amount of wealth

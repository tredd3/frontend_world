--------------- Berkshire portfolio constitution, subsidiaries/Investments -------------------------
Types of businesses: 95% businesses are classified in 3 categories
1)consumer goods
2)consumer services
3)business services

Berkshire portfolio was a mix of 2:
1)Growth(for capital appreciation), most of the growth firms don't generate free cash bcoz of expenses (advertisement/Capex/R&D)
usage of free cash flow: to reinvest instead of buyback/dividends
2)Non-growth companies(for stable cashflow), all the firms generate free cash flow (which is used to buyback/dividends )
 Since berkshire acquires the entire businesses, The stable cash flow generated by non-growth companies are used to acquire other 
 growth/non-growth companies and the process repeats every year generating enoromous wealth(i.e compounding effect of consistency 
 investment in quality companies)
Note: Buffet says no to almost everything provided he don't understand/trust/forecast the business

/Not all companies have all the traits of a perfect company but only 2 are core(Predictability, Valuation)
/companies are niche/focused but overall portfolio is diversified
/Most of them are market leaders
/In each category - they have held 1 or max 2 companies (market leaders with strong moats) or buy all the top companies if the 
  sector is interesting(all airlines/all japan trading companies)
/Most of them are consumer facing , luxury, business services and low cost producers
/Global footprint - few of them
/Also companies  in few sectors are outdated in today’s world
/Invested in govt controlled companies/PSUs only if they are exceptional and predictable - petrochina(never interacted with management
 simply read annual report , got to know that 45% give away of earnings and hence invested in it)
/All the energy companies(asset heavy) are controlled by Berkshire or private players
/Never invested in any commodity companies - like metal mining companies etc
/Never invested in cyclical and one time(non-recurring) businesses
/Invest in companies with superior economics - Never invests in sin companies or any company that effect people's health (tobacco)
 or watse people's time and money (casino)

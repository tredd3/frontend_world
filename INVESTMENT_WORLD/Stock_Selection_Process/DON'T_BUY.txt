--------------------------- companies to AVOID ------------------------------
GOLDEN RULES: 
  Never buy a business that you don't understand
  Never buy a business that changes too often that you can't predict it for the next 10 years

/CONTINOUSLY needs to add and upgrade capex to stay in business like infra comapnies (telecom, energy, airlines, utilities)
  why not to buy? - every year the additional capital we pump in the business goes for maintenance and upgradation(i.e for sustainence)
  if the company doesn't have pricing power and there is a inflation taking capital goods price higher - then also they will 
    take hit on profits. Even worse is that if the company already has a debt it may go bankrupt or will sell other assets
  Solution: 
  However you can buy companies providing services to above sectors as those comapnies will be at the receiving end and the
  above sectors will be at the spending end.
  e.g: GMM Faudler (proxy play on chemical and pharma capex), RHIM (steel & glass capex), ASML (semiconductor capex)
/CONTINOUSLY needs to spend more money on R&D to stay in business like electronics, auto and pharma companies that spend heavily on R&D
 some pharma companies put >40% of revenues in R&D, if it succeeds then new revenue stream but if it fails then stock price will crash
 However if you find an exceptional company(strong MOAT) which is both efficient and profitable in above sectors then buy
 Solution : proxy play
   e.g: LTTS (R&D spending by big companies goes as revenues to these companies)
       Tarsons (pharma and chemical R&D, hospital & diagnostic chain)
/companies that have HUGE debt or need to take debt CONTINOUSLY to survive (working capital cycle is high)
during Bull run: it will eat away profits bcoz of interest payments => EPS decreases => share price decreases
during Bear crash: it can make company bankrupt
and also company has to pay interest even if it is in loss => assets needs to be sold => bankruptcy
 Solution : Invest in banks & Financial firms with conservative & strong management
/Combination of working capital heavy(need more capital/cash to generate sales) + more CCC days(need more time to generate
 cash from operations) => deadly combination and a sure shot wealth destructor
/Avoid industries that are highly competetive and no compnay has a DCA like auto, telecom, aviation industries - as 
    no company sales can grow consistently and none can make huge profits due to zero pricing power
  Solution: Proxy play on Auto, telecom and Aviation parts suppliers or services providers
  e.g: Suprajit , Rajratan Global
/Avoid companies that compete on price - invest in companies that compete on providing value addition
Companies in heavy competetive market like Food delivery,E-commerce,Aviation are loss making because they always burn cash in 
the form of discounts to attract customers as customers always search for discounted prices and not ready to pay premium.
/Avoid commodity stocks like metals (unless u know the commodity cycle and track its prices ,global demand and  supply etc) because
 price is decided globally and it can take you around 80-90% down if you enter at he wrong time.
/Avoid serial Acquirers like Zydus but if it is for strategic purpose(augumenting existing business) or pure investment related purposes
  then its fine else acquiring companies to become a conglomerate is bad.
   /Avoid companies that has grown only because of Acquisitions(like Zydus, Workday etc) because of the below reasons:
  i) company will not have that USP built in , it will not have any core philosophy and hence might not attract investors. 
  ii)Also the cost at which it is acquiring companies is very important. what if all the acquired companies work culture is 
    different ? there will not be any synergy rather it will be very complex for the management to handle putting the companies revenues and growth for a toss.
  iii)The acquired companies might not augument/bring in much value to existing operations
  iv)management will not have a mindset to fix the business model, rather always think of few more acquisitions to solve the
    all the problems mentioned.
   However if the price at which the companies are acquired is low and the quality of the acquired companies(subsidaries) 
   is great then we can consider holding the company like (infoedge and bekshire has acquired companies that doesn't provide any 
   strategic role , they acquired it for investment purposes and they are doing great as an investment so that is fine)
   Similarly Facebook(acquired wtsapp, instagram etc) for strategic purpose(to strengthen their presence in social platform) and
   keep the competettion at bay.
/over diversification - enetering in to businesses or acquiring businesses that doesn't belong to the expertise level of the current 
  company it is bound to see losses.Moreover overdiversification sometimes leads to producing of avg revenues as all the profitable
  businesses revenue will be nullified with bad/Average ones
  However if the company does the reverse and sell all the unrelated businesses then it will be a turnaround oppurtunity
/Avoid companies that are dependent on govt OR Linked to Govt:
  banning imports, anti dumping duty, govt subsidies/schemes like PLI - bcoz once govt lifts bans then importers will take away the 
   market share and eat profits, moreover Govt might not be able to ban imports bcoz of International rules 
  Govt is a major or only customer - delayed payments, no pricing power has govt decides the prices in tenders
  Govt or Govt Agencies control the pricing - CDSL,BSE, MCX, IRCTC
/Avoid companies where order inflows are majorly from limited clients or will get orders only on low bidding(here others can 
 take over or it will put pressure on margins) -  bargaining power of buyers will come in to existence and company will not have 
 bargaining power it will just be a puppet else it will lose busniess. Also company's future is highly dependent on fortunes
 of the client business
/Avoid Cyclical companies with irregular growth  or too high growth in small span (50%/100% growth rate in 1-2 years) - this is unsustainable
/No new development of products or not catching up with current trends - whereas its competettiors do
/B2B companies(suppliers) that doesn't have pricing power because of high competettion, commoditised or no MOATs
 if the company increases price clients will look for other alternatives as the client margins squeeze as they need to procur these 
 in bulk and the clients always ask for disounts and if the B2B company don't give them discounts clients profitability is 
 affected leading to contract termination 
Note: Hence B2B companies are always a price play. Unless they have some USP or they are low cost producer or they are in niche space
i.e low competettion you are not supposed to buy 
E.g: L&T, Intel , Nvidia etc bcoz they established a sense of trust/brand/customer loyalty with the end consumers
TSMC/ASML - R&D and Skilled workforce is so good that, no one was able to crack them even with huge amounts of capital for more 
 than a decade
/Avoid companies with limited market size and there is no option of scalability of business model - as the companies doesn't have 
  an option to expand beyond a certain point they might grow in short term but cannot be a multibagger in the longterm
   companies market whose market is limited to only domestic and that too only few businesses/clients need it - CAMS, MCX, BSE
/Avoid companies whose business can be taken away or replicated by putting large amounts of money by biggies - must check this 
  for high margin businesses , hottest sectors
 e.g: diagnostic chains 
/hotest trending stocks - you can be locked at very expensive valuation
  Avoid hottest stock in the hottest industry like KPIT/Tanla/Route Mobile bcoz u need to continously rebuild the MOAT
  problem with the tech/hottest industry: it attracts smart people and someone in the world will always try and get the technology 
  products at cheaper price hence instead of focusing on tech stocks focus on companies that use this tech and become EFFICIENT. 
  Now tomorrow when the R&D people succeed and come with a low cost product, 
  Solution: Buy the company that is already using the tech will be more PROFITABLE (infact EFFICIENT + PROFITABLE)
/stocks with buzz of next IBM, next Microsoft, next HUL etc - why don't you focus on existing brands and learn why they have become
 brands, instead of focusing on the next/upcoming brands
 However if you have studied and know the success mantra of brands and find a company that is replicating it, then  you can conside
  buying it. for e.g: IDFC First bank has a CEO, who has a proven track record and following the footsteps of HDFC Bank interms
  of shifting the focus to retail sector instead of infra and wholesale where the chances of loan default is high
/Avoid companies that need a superstar manager to run it : bcoz the MOAT of the company is the manager himself.
  if he goes from the company MOAT also goes and we don't want to own such businesses (However Financial companies are excluded)

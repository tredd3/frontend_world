***** GOLDEN RULES *********
Decision ONLY  based on facts(news, reports) and reasoning(think, compare), not on opinion and emotions
Provide Continuous fuel and efficiency to the process: keep updated with present knowledge

HAVE KNOWLEDGE BEFORE INVESTING - MORE KNOWLEDGE === LESS RISK
Stay in your circle of competence - invest only in industries which you understand, believe and predictable

Growth and Value investing: both are same just that the growth rates and discount rates changes for DCF calculation 
Growth stocks : high growth rates, high discount rates
Value Stocks : low growth rates, low discount rates
Note: fundamental concept of price vs value remians the same. But investing in a growth stock at random prices and waiting 
  for price to go up is pure speculation

FORTUNE: when oppurtunity meets prepared mind, meaning keep reading about companies, keep youself updated with the knowledge 
  and trends even though you never got a chance to buy the best companies that is fine (one day or the other you are bound to get it)

Risks in Stock Market/Investing
1)Loss of Capital
2)Not getting Adequate returns

Short term - PE is significant(speculator focus), long term - earnings are significant(investor focus)
SO, LONG TERM INVESTOR SHOULD HAVE A OWNER MINDSET: 
 Always consider you are buying the whole company for market cap/EV and not a single stock
 focus on business not on share price, bcoz if earnings increase market sentiment(P/E) increases and so do share price)
for immediate deployment of cash - look at current interest rates (if current interest rates are high then there will be a large 
 sell off across other asset classes like equities, land, real estate you need to be careful here because the prices keep moving 
  down and might be locked at higher price for long time)
similarly if interest rates are low people invest the money in other asset classes apart from bonds driving the prices higher

There is STOCK and then there is Business behind the stock
e.g: we have Apple stock and we have Apple business(FOCUS on business bcoz in the longterm stock price MUST follow Business
 performance it doesn't have a choice) Moreover stock price tells u what investors have paid over the years for that business
 Also you can compare how much they are paying today compared to instrinsic value of the business


Investing is a combination of SCIENCE and ART
It is not pure SCIENCE because formulas that we aply today might not be relevant tomorrow in the changing business scenario
It is not pure ART because then u will only imagine and speculate without knowing the data and doing any calculation

Success Criteria = Long term vision + Courage + Patience + Discipline(in investing,learning,knowledge upgradation)
How much Patience? - few stocks take 5-10yrs to become multi baggers (keep udating the story and track the earnings unless they both
 are good your patience will be rewarded with a multi bagger)

INVEST IN YOURSELF: Read and analyse News - link it with ur investment , Books, finance Videos

DON'T TIME THE MARKET -  you can never predict the market except in certain situations like war, You only need to react
when everyone is greedy be fearful and when everyone is fearful be greedy
Mr.Market: every minute price keeps changing you don't have to participate in that just ignore

Cash is not good investment - inflation will reduce its worth Invest in productive assets

Compounding is the 8th wonder - time is the key, make the most of it by investing early (either invest in a business or invest in 
  a person skills)


THERE IS A DIFF between good company and good investment.
excellent company at expensive valuation is still a bad investment
Note: Great product might not make the company great and great company can not be a great investment at high valuations
e.g: CISCO is a good company but it spends most of the returns on R&D and capex
Sony is a good brand but it doesn't have pricing power


RISK LIES IN THE PRICE AND NOT ASSET CLASS - buy assets at cheaper price
Even Buying great companies at higher valuation is also a poor investment
always have margin of safety so that you have cushion incase your predictions went wrong or future screws up


MARGIN OF SAFETY: depends on the company
excellent and predictable businesses margin of safety can be less
for unpredictable businesses margin of safety should be more
Note: sometimes it takes years for a stock to be available at a fair price/undervaluation. Patience is the key 


HOW TO BUY: 
Buy Great business at fair price instead of buying fair business at a wonderful price
  if u buy a company that is generating 6% ROCE at huge discount and hold it for say 20 yrs - you will still get 6% returns
  but if u buy a company that is in your circle of competence and is generating 15% ROCE at higher price and hold it for say 
  20 yrs - it will create huge wealth
Seize the opportunity and play big if you get wonderful businesses at great price/undervalued price - if you don't play big 
  it is as good as not playing at all
Always Invest in tranches bcoz we don't know if the market is gona fall further and we need to have capital to invest more
Don't sell a quality business just to invest in a fair business at undervaluation(wonderful price) or just because the price is 
 too high because few companies always trade at higher prices throughout their lifetime.
you only need to sell a business if the management disaapoints you or economics of the business changed in a big way
Note: when a solid company delivers poor results, news about economy/sector degrowth can be buy oppurtunities for long term investors
try to hold quality businesses as long as possible(to get compounding effect)
When market falls it's a happy moment because you can accumulate business or increase the ownership of the existing businesses
  at a great price
if you limit the no of stocks to be included you will be extra careful in selecting the businesses

***** GOLDEN RULES *********
//Success Criteria:
 1)General
 Owner Mindset: Always consider you are buying the whole company for market cap/EV and not a single stock
 Investing is a combination of SCIENCE and ART
  It is not pure SCIENCE because formulas that we aply today might not be relevant tomorrow in the changing business scenario
  It is not pure ART because then u will only imagine and speculate without knowing the data and doing any calculation
 Intrinsic Value changes every year, Price changes every second
 Contrarian - when everyone is greedy be fearful and when everyone is fearful be greedy
 RISK LIES IN THE PRICE AND NOT ASSET CLASS - buy assets at cheaper price
  Even Buying great companies at higher valuation is also a poor investment
  always have margin of safety so that you have cushion incase your predictions went wrong or future screws up
 you need max 2-3 oppurtunities in a year , if you limit the no of stocks to be included you will be extra careful in selecting the businesses

 2)Behavioural
 Long term vision - start early and invest for as long as possible (Compounding is the 8th wonder - time is the key)
 Courage - to invest lumpsum during market crash
   Seize the opportunity and play big if you get wonderful businesses at great price - if you don't play big 
  it is as good as not playing at all
 Patience - few stocks take 5-10yrs to become multi baggers (keep udating the story and track the earnings unless they both
   are good your patience will be rewarded with a multi bagger)
 Discipline(like doing SIPs and continous learning and knowledge upgradation)
 

//Risks in Stock Market/Investing
1)Loss of Capital
  Remedy:
  Generalist Learner, specalist Investor(LILU style): meaning you should know about every business possible(not in depth but a rough 
    idea) but you should Stay in your circle of competence - invest only in industries which you understand, believe and predictable
  Decision ONLY  based on facts(news, reports) and reasoning(think, compare), not on opinion and emotions
2)Not getting Adequate returns
  Remedy:
  MARGIN OF SAFETY: depends on the company
  excellent and predictable businesses margin of safety can be less
  for unpredictable businesses margin of safety should be more
  Note: sometimes it takes years for a stock to be available at a fair price/undervaluation. Patience is the key 
3)Volatility of share price is not a risk it's an opputunity, Volatility of cashflow is a risk

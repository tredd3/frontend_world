***** GOLDEN RULES *********
Risks in Stock Market/Investing
1)Loss of Capital
2)Not getting Adequate returns

HAVE KNOWLEDGE BEFORE INVESTING - MORE KNOWLEDGE === LESS RISK
Stay in your circle of competence - invest in industries which you understand or believe

Success Criteria = Long term vision + Courage + Patience + Discipline(in investing,learning,knowledge upgradation)
How much Patience? - few stocks take 5-10yrs to become multi baggers (keep udating the story and track the earnings unless they both
 are good your patience will be rewarded with a multi bagger)

INVEST IN YOURSELF: Read and analyse News - link it with ur investment , Books, finance Videos

DON'T TIME THE MARKET - You only need to react.
e.g: if the market falls buy stocks, if it raises bcoz of high PE and no earnings backup then sell

Cash is not good investment - inflation will reduce its worth Invest in productive assets

Compounding is the 8th wonder - time is the key, make the most of it by investing early

when everyone is greedy be fearful and when everyone is fearful be greedy

THERE IS A DIFF between good company and good investment.
excellent company at expensive valuation is still a bad investment
Note: Great product might not make the company great and great company can not be a great investment at high valuations

Short term - PE is significant(speculator focus), long term - earnings are significant(investor focus)
SO, LONG TERM INVESTOR SHOULD HAVE A OWNER MINDSET: focus on business not on share price, bcoz if earnings increase market sentiment(P/E) increases and 
  hence share price eventually increases)
In Long term stock increases only because of EARNINGS (hence earning power of a company is very important)


RISK LIES IN THE PRICE AND NOT ASSET CLASS - buy assets at cheaper price
Even Buying great companies at higher valuation is also a poor investment
always have margin of safety so that you have cushion incase your predictions went wrong or future screws up


MARGIN OF SAFETY: depends on the company
excellent and predictable businesses margin of safety can be less
for unpredictable businesses margin of safety should be more
Note: sometimes it takes years for a stock to be available at a fair price/undervaluation. Patience is the key 


HOW TO BUY: 
Buy Great business at fair price instead of buying fair business at a wonderful price
  if u buy a company that is generating 6% ROCE at huge discount and hold it for say 20 yrs - you will still get 6% returns
  but if u buy a company that is in your circle of competence and is generating 15% ROCE at higher price and hold it for say 
  20 yrs - it will create huge wealth
Seize the opportunity and play big if you get wonderful businesses at great price/undervalued price
Always Invest in tranches bcoz we don't know if the market is gona fall further and we need to have capital to invest more
Don't sell a quality business just to invest in a fair business at undervaluation
Note: when a solid company delivers poor results, news about economy/sector degrowth can be buy oppurtunities for long term investors
try to hold quality businesses as long as possible(to get compounding effect)

//set of companies that can be a good buy
Lynch says he would prefer simple business model + average management + no competettion (easy to follow and if any fool 
 can run this business means the business in itself has a MOAT and it doesn't depend on person to run it )
Over complex industry + high competettion + good management


****** LESS RISK Companies ********
1.Monopolies - look at market share and market size , also sector growth
2.all weather companies/defensive stocks - earnings are consistent in all kinds of economic situations
3.globally competitive - diversified revenue/customer base/global expansion oppurtunities
4.consumer recognised brands like FMCG companies - pricing power and continuous demand
5.companies producing daily use essential goods/services used by public :
babies: Johnson & Johnson products
Kids: biscuits(Britannia, hide and seek, Oreo), Choclates(nestle),fast food
Women: makeup , beauty and personal products, gold and jewellery (Nykaa, Titan)
Adults: investment, banking,  finance, automobile (parts manufacturing, tires, petrol, engine oils, batteries), 
 electronics(parts manufacturing)

Family: agriculture, insurance, pharma, food, beverages, FMCG like ITC, HUL, power (coal, solar), clothing (inners like Rupa, jockey)


*******GOOD dividend paying companies ******
Companies which not only pay good dividend but also their dividend payment increases every yr
* Net profit/income increasing for last 5 yrs?
*  Check if the EPS has grown in last 5 years.
* Also check if DPS - dividend per share has grown in last 5 years.
* Compare if EPS growth and dividend per share growth are similar.
* Dividend yield can sometimes be misleading, i.e if share price decreases dividend yield seems to be high
* Dividend payout should also be more
Moral of the story: It is important to look at dividend yield, but in conjunction with other fundamentals like sales, profit, EPS, dividend payout %, etc.
Also reinvest the dividend in other dividend paying stocks


------ Companies that can have wider MOAT and are highly profitable in the long run --------
Golden rule: prefer asset lite business model

AMC (MOAT: Economies of scale, Switching cost)
Business services - tech based/people based
media/Entertainment
Healthcare
Basket of IT/Software companies
deals with very sensitive sectors needing lot of approvals and gain client trust/confidence - high entry barriers
niche/extreme niche - does something very specific which takes a lot of time to build (MOAT: entry barriers, switching cost)
New age businesses that has a capacity to suffer - i.e they are diverting profits to build long term moats 
  Noet: always buy them only when they are profitable for like 2 yrs in a row, bcoz of most of them might not be profitable and you
  will lose money
Lousy industries: find companies operating in boring/lousy industries where no one wants to enter or companies in that sector
   facing heavy loses and low profitability or no growth(which means some companies if manged well can become market leaders by 
   capturing market share from losers/bankruptors - even a survivor for longtime can become a gem)
   lousy industries : steel, textiles, aviation, telecom
  It does something dull and less profitable(manufacturing bottle caps, plastic forks) - demand throughout the year but no new 
  competettion wants to enter this business (MOAT: entry barriers, switching cost)
  It does something disagreeable and profitable(waste management, cleaning, chappals, underwear) - demand throughout the year but 
  no new competettion wants to do this because of the nature of the business (MOAT: entry barriers, switching cost)
  high capex is needed no one wants to enter or it is difficult to build such infra in less time (GAIL, powergrid, IOCL)
   
repeat business - people need to keep buying it to survive/daily needs (MOAT: low cost producer, Brand, distribution network)
Platform/Infrastucture Business(Indiamart, IEX, Amazon, Zomato) - (MOAT: Economies of scale, Switching cost, Distribution network)

  -companies in niche industries can also make fortunes - because of low competettion and first mover advantage like Mapmyindia
  -highly competetive industries: auto , FMCG ,cement etc - A new player entering in to a highly competetive industry cannot make
    fortunes becuase it is difficult to replace market leaders or take away their share

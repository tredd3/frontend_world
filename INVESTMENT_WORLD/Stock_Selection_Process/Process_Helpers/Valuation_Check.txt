-------------------------- Valuation -------------------------
Talk about valuations only if Business QUALITY is good , else no point in buying the company as iam a longterm investor

*VALUATION RATIOS - talk about valuations only if business and management analysis is positive
PE < 25(govt 10 yr bond yield) ? 
High P/E => earnings may be less due to recession or one time costs OR market is paying premium as they believe earnings will increase at a faster rate
check PEG to confirm , premium is justified only when PEG < 2
Note: PE of a company might be less bcoz of the riskiness, cyclical nature, capex intensive and more capital requirement etc
Low PE => inflated earnings due to one time income or any other manipulation OR any fundamentally wrong with the company
Also PE < Industry PE?
-PE is generally compared with peers PE, but PE for other companies is based on their financial condition, hence not a great measure
PE < 5yr median PE? also check the historical PE range (most reliable approach for established firms)
-for young companies it might not be relevant as they business outlook and financials might have changed
PEG ratio: 
-find out the earnings growth rate and check if they are releastic (check source of earnings section in FUTURE)
PB: 
Note: imp for capex intensive(fixed assets - old value) and financial firms(liquid assets - current value),makes less sense for service based companies
Also don't forget to look at goodwill when you are valueing a firm based on PB value
Bargain: if ROE is consistently high(i.e equity/book value is increasing) and PB value is less compared to peers
PB - NA for a B2C company,if PB is applicable check ROA
EV/EBITDA:
EV/EBITDA < 10 - excellent company
EV/EBITDA < 14 - can be considered
EV/EBITDA > 14 - high valuation
EV/EBITDA < industry EV/EBITDA and compare it with peers of same size
cash return: free cashflow as a % of EV?
EV= market_cap + long_term debt - cash
compare this yield/cash_return with longterm bonds/FDs => if it is almost similar and the earnings of the company is bound to grow
hence better to invest in the company else invest in the FDs or bonds


------------------- INTRINSIC Value Importance and Calculation ------------------
//Problem with valuation ratios :
1)they are relative - i.e they are least useful if used alone and are generally used to compare with peers
2)They don't tell anything about value(i.e how much the firm is actually worth) - ratios are based on price and they only 
tell u how much price an investor is paying wrt peers.
3)Business should be compared with peers but valuation should ONLY be based on instrinsic value of that company alone and not based on peer position
why: PE for other companies is based on their financial condition and business outlook, lets say a company has poor outlook and
financials then PE is obviously less and the company we are looking at may seem like overvalued but looking at intrinsic value it
may be undervalued and might miss the oppurtunity assuming it is overvalued so we can't say whether the company is 
overvalued/undervalued by comparing ratios with peers.
4)Book value in PB can go down significantly as the assets value decreases when company files for bankruptcy. so if u think u are getting 
high value assets at lower price (P/B < 1) then always check what is there on the asset side(natural resources like land, gold, silver,
oil etc is fine but random real estate, machinery, inventory values can down significantly during auction)


// hence finding intrinsic value is imp or valuing companies based on cashflows comes in the picture
If cash flow regular? 
  calculate DCF valuation :

      Market cap < DCF valuation, both PE and earnings are less?, check valuation ratios - stock undervalued, hence buy it
      Market cap ~= DCF - fairly valued, check valuation ratios
      Market cap > DCF - stock overvalued (put in watchlist and do averaging down/up based on the company)
  also check price to cash_flow /price to free cash_flow
Else 
	buy based on relative valuations mentioned in advanced/company_valuation.txt


------------------- INTRINSIC Value Verification ------------------
verify your calculated value with others:

Note: even if a company has DCA, if you buy at high price the returns will be like a mediocre company
1)SIP via averaging up when price increases by 50%
increase SIP if price falls due to external factors
2)wait for the bear markets 
3)if company faces a temporary solvable problem , share price go down and you can grab

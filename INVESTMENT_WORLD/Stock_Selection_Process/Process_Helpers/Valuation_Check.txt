-------------------------- Valuation -------------------------
GOLDEN RULES:
Valuation keeps changing every year - as the business grows or shrinks
Valuation is very tricky as well as it depends on individual perception
1)Talk about valuations only if Business QUALITY is good , else no point in buying the company as a longterm investor
2)Don't overpay: Even if a company has DCA, if you buy at high price the returns will be like a mediocre company
3)if a company has wide MOATS(must have, otherwise profits are not sustainable in the future) clubbed with high ROCE and high free 
cash flow(generally non-growth generates high free cash and very few growth companies generate free cash) then we can pay 
premium(don't overpay), provided  you are ready to hold it for a longer period (10+ yrs) which justifies high valuation
*** To value such stocks terminal multiple should be high bcoz of their ability to sustain earnings for a long period but discount
rate should be low(current interest rates) as they are relatively safe(like debt instruments)
Note: if inflation increases and central banks increase interest rates to curb inflation then intrinsic value of the companies
  decrease and they seem overvalued(but it is a short term phenomenon)
4)PRICE and VALUATION - both are not same
if Share price of a company increases at slower rate but earnings increase at higher rate then - Low Valuation
if Share price of a company decreases at certain rate but earnings decrease at higher rate then - High Valuation
5)There's no one method that's best suited for every situation. Each stock is different, and each industry or sector
 has unique characteristics that may require multiple valuation methods.


//Valuation Terminology:
*capital: equity +debt
*Fair value= Free cash flows/(rate-growth)
*Discount Rate = minimum expected return rate per year by the company for infinite period (WACC is generally used)
*WACC is the minimum required return for a firm (expected equity returns by shareholder is roughly 14% + debt cost is the interest rate at which company took the loan)
companies always target to earn more returns than WACC
go through EY, BCG,Chief Economic Advisor reports on sector growth. expected sector growth should be >= WACC
*Benchmark rates: 
low risk = 6%(govt 10 yr bond yield)
Medium	risk = 15%(Nifty)
High risk= > 20%(individual stocks/sectors/MFs etc) 
*Enterprise value(EV) is a more accurate measure of a company's real worth because it takes into consideration its debt obligations. 
EV = market_cap +  outstanding preferred stock + all debt(short and long term) - all of its cash and cash equivalents.
i.e if u want to buy a company, u need to pay the shareholders, lenders. However u will get the cash held by company


--------------------- VALUATION RATIOS (Relative Valuation)-------------------------
Note: 
compare valuation ratios of the company with other companies in the SAME sector and same industry ,also of same size to know
the actual value/performance compared to peers .
P/E of similar companies (ICICI, HDFC but don’t compare ICICI with Dena bcoz of diff in scale, area of operation,
 products ,management etc )

1)PE < 25(govt 10 yr bond yield) ? 
High P/E => earnings may be less due to recession or one time costs OR market is paying premium as they believe earnings will increase at a faster rate
check PEG to confirm , premium is justified only when PEG < 2
Note: PE of a company might be less bcoz of the riskiness, cyclical nature, capex intensive and more capital requirement etc
Low PE => inflated earnings due to one time income or any other manipulation OR any fundamentally wrong with the company
Also PE < Industry PE?
-PE is generally compared with peers PE, but PE for other companies is based on their financial condition, hence not a great measure
PE < 5yr median PE? also check the historical PE range (most reliable approach for established firms)
-for young companies it might not be relevant as they business outlook and financials might have changed
PEG ratio: 
-find out the earnings growth rate and check if they are releastic (check source of earnings section in FUTURE)
2)PB: 
Note: imp for capex intensive like utilities(fixed assets - old value) and financial firms(liquid assets - current value),
  this parameter makes less sense for service based companies

//when you are valuing a firm based on PB value
Check ROA , i.e how much earnings is the company generating from its assets
Also don't forget to look at balance strength :
-if Goodwill is more on the assets side but the acquired companies are not able to generate profits then Book value significantly 
  decreases because people won't buy the company or value the company for the price at which u have bought
-intangible assets that help u in creating some value or they themselves have some value that others are willing to pay is fine else
  they also can loose value like crazy
-cash , land and  financial investments won't lose value - indicating that the balance sheet is strong
Bargain: if ROE is consistently high(i.e equity/book value is increasing) and PB value is less compared to peers

3)EV/EBITDA or EV/EBIT: for capex heavy companies where depreciation eats a lot of revenue
EV/EBITDA < 10 - excellent company
EV/EBITDA < 14 - can be considered
EV/EBITDA > 14 - high valuation
EV/EBITDA < industry EV/EBITDA and compare it with peers of same size
cash return: free cashflow as a % of EV?
EV= market_cap + long_term debt - cash
compare this yield/cash_return with longterm bonds/FDs => if it is almost similar and the earnings of the company is bound to grow
hence better to invest in the company else invest in the FDs or bonds
4)price to sales: for new age companies that are not yet profitable
5)Market cap to free cash flow - FMCG and mature companies generating lot of cash
MCAP/FCF is 10 meaning you get your money back in 10 yrs and rest of your life you are getting things for free
Note: before calculation MCAP/FCF subtract Total cash from MCAP i.e final ratio is (MCAP - Total Cash)/FCF
Total cash = (cash+cash equivalents - total debt)
6)Dividend yield > bank interest rates (6%) - if investing for dividends
check dividend payout ratio and cash flow analysis to check what part of cash is dividends
dividend payout ratio is the ratio of the total amount of dividends paid out to shareholders relative to the net income of the company
Dividend yield  = dividend_amount/share_price * 100
7)compare market cap with Total cash(cash+cash equivalents - total debt)
if total cash > market cap OR total cash = 30% or market cap (then you are technically getting the share at 70% of share price)


------------------- INTRINSIC Value Importance and Calculation (Absolute Valuation) ------------------
//Problem with valuation ratios :
1)they are relative - i.e they are least useful if used alone and are generally used to compare with peers
2)They don't tell anything about value(i.e how much the firm is actually worth) - ratios are based on price and they only 
tell u how much price an investor is paying wrt peers.
3)Business should be compared with peers but valuation should ONLY be based on instrinsic value of that company alone and not based on peer position
why: PE for other companies is based on their financial condition and business outlook, lets say a company has poor outlook and
financials then PE is obviously less and the company we are looking at may seem like overvalued but looking at intrinsic value it
may be undervalued and might miss the oppurtunity assuming it is overvalued so we can't say whether the company is 
overvalued/undervalued by comparing ratios with peers.
4)Book value in PB can go down significantly as the assets value decreases when company files for bankruptcy. so if u think u are getting 
high value assets at lower price (P/B < 1) then always check what is there on the asset side(natural resources like land, gold, silver,
oil etc is fine but random real estate, machinery, inventory values can down significantly during auction)

*** Hence finding intrinsic value is imp or valuing companies based on cashflows comes in the picture

1)DCF valuation for the entire company considering the base
If cash flow regular? 
    Based on Earnings: calculate earnings after 10yrs  based on the previous 10yr earnings growth rate, now multiply the predicted
      earnings with estimated PE to get the estimated market_cap. Now calculate the rate at which the current market cap grows
       to achieve the estimated marketcap in next 10yrs. if it < 15% then better to invest in index funds
    Based on Cashflow: same as above replace earnings with cashflow and PE with MCAP/FCF

      Market cap < DCF valuation, both PE and earnings are less?, check valuation ratios - stock undervalued, hence buy it
      Market cap ~= DCF - fairly valued, check valuation ratios
      Market cap > DCF - stock overvalued (put in watchlist and do averaging down/up based on the company)
Else 
	buy based on relative valuations mentioned above

2)DCF valuation for each segment of the company - if company has multiple business segments/divisons OR SUBSIDARIES
then valuation of each segment/each subsidary needs to be combined to arrive at the overall valuation of the company 
For e.g: facebook advertising business itself is worth the whole market cap
meaning u get the metaverse business for free


3)Industry Growth rate related
Assume that auto sales will increase 10% every year , you get the final number 
For e.g: say that the total market size for Auto sales  in FY25 or 5 yrs down the line == 100 billion 
Now Maruti suziki which has 40% market share , will have the revenue of 40 billion (Assuming it retains market share)
if  operating leverage > 1 then use operating leverage to calculate operating income and then net income
else use NPM
here lets say maruti has operating leverage 1, then NPM of Maruti is say 20% meaning 20% of 40 billion == 8 billion (net profit)
PE or historical PE == 40
now expected market cap = Net Income * PE = 8*40 = 320 billion 
current market cap = say 100 billion
You need to calculate the rate, to know at what % CAGR your money will grow assuming you bought the whole company at 100 billion 
and held it for 4yrs till it reaches 320 billion.
Note: if this rate is < 15% then index funds are the best option for now else u can invest in the company if rate > 15%


4)Macroeconomic oppurtunity
Lets say IEX has just 5% of total electricity trade flowing through its servers.
Even if that becomes 30% (bcoz of unorganised to organised shift) then IEX revenue will become 6 times
if  operating leverage > 1 then use operating leverage to calculate operating income and then net income
else use NPM
Expected MCAP will become = 6*current profit * PE (after this same calculation will apply)
Now the stock will respond accordingly making it a multibagger

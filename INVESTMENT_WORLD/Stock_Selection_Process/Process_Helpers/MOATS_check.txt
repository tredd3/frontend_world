How to identify Great businesses? 
Every company is like an empire which has economic moats(strengths/advantages)
Economic MOATS - strengths that are not easy to break by competitors / market trends/ public choice or decision/Govt intervention
Note: some Sectors itself have  moats irrespective of what company it is, in such cases always find MOATS specfic to the company
e.g: Music streaming business has a MOAT of 60yrs predictable cashflows but that is not specific to a company , it is specific to
  a industry
Conclusion: if the sector itself has growth or moats then invest in sector specific mutual funds

//Types of MOATs:
1)deep MOATs 
only one MOAT exists OR MOATs exist for only few of its product lines 
e.g: chawanprash (Dabur)
2)wide MOATs
multiple MOATs exist OR MOATs exist for almost all of its product lines - if some MOAT goes wrong others will protect you, 
  meaning ROCE will be sustainable for longterm


//All possible MOATs
1)ECONOMIES OF SCALE: it is the ability of the firm to leverage its fixed cost infrastructure across various customers
 in other words firms spread their fixed costs over large units of products - bringing down the cost of single product unit
 operating leverage of the firm increases because of this ability.(check in profit loss statement last line - tijori )
 for e.g if operating leverage is 3 => means if revenues grow by x then operating income grows  by 3x (not net income)
 Note: if operating leverage is very high because of fixed costs company can be wildly profitable and expand margins , but it
  can also be bankrupt if it has high debt and sales decrease(check debt levels, especially interest wrt operating profit)
 so to have this MOAT companies must focus on revenue increase by increasing sales volume
e.g: AMC, Insurance companies, Banks - no matter how much money flows in, the money manager will be given same salary and the 
 operating cost are very much fixed
 Airlines, Telecom , GAIL , IOCL - irrespective of the voulmes the cost to operate single unit /handle single customer is equal
    to handling multiple units/handling multiplying customers

2)LOW COST PRODUCER:
 customer loyalty is high(customer keeps coming because he gets quality product/service at low cost) - airlines, commodity companies
  should have this moat otherwise they can't suvive
  3 ways of becoming low cost producer:
  --Process based : Dell manufacturers products only after recieving order(saving inventory costs), GEICO sells insurance policies
    over phone instead of conventional agent route (saving agent payments), outsource manufacturing (save capex upgradation and 
    maintenance costs)
  --Structure based: vertically/backward integrated meaning u don't have to depend on others - Tata steel is the lowest producer of 
    steel in the world as it has access to its own mines
  --Economies of scale(Demand side) - demand for low cost quality product increases, i.e more and more people want to buy it
   Microsoft develops a software once and as more customers use it , the cost of software per customer decreases
   Amazon (AWS, prime) - unique products whose price depends on number of people using it
   Note: More relevant for service based companies, single product development and reuse companies
  --Economies of scale(Supply side) - when output/supply increases production cost per product decreases as fixed costs like 
     warehouse , distribution network maintenance costs, technology upgradation costs are spread over products manufactured/supplied
  Double edged sword: Economies of scale(Demand side) + Economies of scale(Supply side) => very very cheap products(Amazon, maruti)
  but if supply is increased to take advantage of Economies of scale(Supply side) and there is not enough demand then inventory costs
   will increase and company might get in to debt trap
  --other ways of saving costs if u can think of
Once you are a low cost producer , use the profits to bring costs even further (advertisement spending, campaigning)
//Note: New companies cannot break this moat bcoz they will be in loss. 

3)BRAND Loyalty- public must trust the product and ready to pay premium for it 
It takes many years to build because customers recognise a company as a brand if the firm consistently produces products/services
 that have highest quality compared to competitors
Real product differentiation - i.e products are more popular => but constant innovation is needed and lot of cash is sucked up
Percieved product differentiation - Brand name itself is enough people are ready to pay premium(importance of BRAND)
Advertisement plays a major role in implanting the name of the company as a brand in customers mind
E.g: Nestle, LIC, HDFC, SBI
//Note: ONLY brand name cannot be a MOAT , it has to be accompained with pricing power
e.g: Sony is a brand but if it increases the price it will lose customers, on the other hand even though BMW raises prices it will
   not loose customers bcoz of its pricing power

4)NETWORK EFFECT :
  wide geographical presence including semi-urban and rural areas
  strong distribution network (more and more people know and use the product)
  quick after sales support as sales centers are present everywhere in the country
  demand side network effect - more and more consumers keep adding
  supply side network effect - more and more merchants keep adding

5)INTANGIBLE ASSETS: 
  --Patents/copyrights: gives right for drug makers to maufacture and sell drugs for almost 20 yrs
//Note: R&D has to be small compared to sales - bcoz if more is spent on R&D and people donâ€™t like the products or if any competitor 
  comes up with more exciting products, then money spent on R&D gets wasted.
  --Human capital (talented, experienced, sticking with company for several years)

6)TASTE - making people habituated with taste
Examples: cococola, Britannia, oreo, amul icecream and most of the FMCG or F&B businesses
for competitors to break this or overcome this hurdle is nearly impossible.
Hence they start negative publicity

7)HIGH ENTRY BARRIER :
 high capex - GAIL, IOCL
 complex operations/heavy machinery operations that needs high skill - MTAR
 not easy to start/replace/maintain - telecom, airlines, Insurance
 high govt regulations(takes long time and process to obtain license) - tobacco(foreign manufacturers can't come and manufacture),
  liqour, telecom(few licenses issues)

8)HIGH SWITCHING COST: (check this mainly for B2B suppliers)
   people/customers won't get much advantage moving to other suppliers(i.e switching cost > benefits of new products as it 
   involves time, money and effort) OR 
   the staff needs to be trained for the usage of the new product(lot of unlearn and relearn) OR 
   ur entire infra/products are build using the existing product/service from a supplier OR
   customer care/support is superb by the current supplier OR
   company made long term contracts with suppliers (and breaking them will cost so much and loss of trust)
Note: high switching costs acts as entry barrier for competitors

9)Luxury/Premium range: People are ready to pay premium because the value addition is huge compared to the price - mostly rich 
 people and businesses focus on it (like Apple, Luxury furniture, Experiences etc)

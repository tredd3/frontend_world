if u invest ur money in a given company u cannot invest in other companies so make sure that u pick the best 
companies possible/u think will become best over the years
3)are people willing to buy the stock for future and take the stock price higher?


--------------- How to reduce risk --------------
Think for some time with a cool and calm mind and you will get all the scenarios - don't predict about macroeconomy because over 
 the years it will and it has to improve.
Keep reading and updating knowledge everyday - you might not invest every year but u need to be 
   updated which reduces ur risk to  a significant amount
Review the stock performance and company performance anually

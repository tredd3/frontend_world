--------------------------------- RISKS --------------------------------------
Think for some time with a cool and calm mind and you will get all the scenarios - don't predict about macroeconomy because over 
 the years it will and it has to improve.
---Business Risk:
competetive risk - threat from existing players or new entrants 
pricing power risk
sector innovation risk (EV,5G)
less market size
substitution risk - mainly for chemical/technology
low cost imports risk
legal/scams Risk
regulatory risk/govt policy risk - power sector(controlling prices),allow imports without anti-dumping duty(chemicals,textiles)
business becoming commodity type(no value addition hence products can be easily copied) - you will lose margins and pricing power


---Financial Risk:
high Debt - can lead to bankruptcy during bear cycle
continous upgradation capex - low returns for shareholders
high spend on R&D - can lead to bankruptcy


---Investment Returns Risk:
1)Loss of Capital
2)Not getting Adequate returns - in the short term u can dream of 25-30% CAGR but in the longterm getting anywhere between 15-25% is
 extraordinary, for this u need to start early
3)are people willing to buy the stock for future and take the stock price higher?

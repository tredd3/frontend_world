--------------------------------- RISKS --------------------------------------
---Business Risk:
Also check RHP/DRHP to see the risks mentioned by the management
competetive risk - threat from existing players or new entrants both local /global
 i.e if the competetitors have enough money can they replace this business and snatch the market share and profits from the company
pricing power risk - during inflation company cannot pass on the price
sector innovation risk (EV,5G)
less market size
substitution risk - mainly for chemical/pharma/technology 
  can company's business/products/services be replaced/substituted by new age technology/innovative products/services?
commoditised risk - business becoming commodity type(no value addition hence products can be easily copied) - you will lose margins and pricing power
low cost imports risk
legal/scams Risk
regulatory risk/govt policy risk - power sector(controlling prices),allow imports without anti-dumping duty(chemicals,textiles)
diworsification risk - if the company keeps acquiring businesses for non-strategic reasons
recession risk - few companies only do well during boom years and get hampered during recession years (better to allocate less capital)

---Financial Risk:
high Debt - can lead to bankruptcy during inflation/recession times, especially if the company has no pricing power
continous upgradation capex - low returns for shareholders (Aviation,Telecom)
high spend on R&D - can lead to bankruptcy, if R&D spend as a % of sales is higher and keeps increasing over time
increasing other income /non-core income - company business might be down or management focusing on non-core activities


---Management Risk
old management, with no succession plan
fraud - related party transactions to the companies in which management/promoters have interest 
not focusing on core business, trying to diworsify
not focusing on share holders
irrelevant skills / experience
short term mindset - management needs to focus on longterm benfits instead of short term profits


---Investment Returns Risk:
1)Loss of Capital
2)Not getting Adequate returns(oppurtunity cost) - if u invest ur money in a given company u cannot invest in other companies
 so make sure that u pick the best companies possible/u think will become best over the years
3)are people willing to buy the stock for future and take the stock price higher?


--------------- How to reduce risk --------------
Think for some time with a cool and calm mind and you will get all the scenarios - don't predict about macroeconomy because over 
 the years it will and it has to improve.
Keep reading and updating knowledge everyday - you might not invest everyyear but u need to be 
   updated which reduces ur risk to  a significant amount
Review the stock performance and company performance anually

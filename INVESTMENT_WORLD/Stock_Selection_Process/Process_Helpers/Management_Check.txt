------------------------------ Management ----------------------------
Investors don't run the show, it is the Management who does that so picking quality management is as important as picking a business
WEAPON: passion + intelligence + honesty(IMPORTANT)
Overall: Management check only makes sense if the business is good
Good Management + bad business => mostly results in BAD business most of the time, very rarely business situation changes
   then it is a turnaround oppurtunity

Promoter check: 
  if promoter is old, sucession plan is important
  history and passion is also important
  promoter pledging - know how much is pledged and the reason for pleding - if more shares are pledged company can go out of hand
FOCUS: 
    -if a comapnay is efficienct then management should focus on growth and maintaing the efficiency of the company 
    -if a comapnay is NOT efficienct then management should focus on increasing the efficiency of the company and then volume led growth 
COMPENSATION:
    -compnesation: variable based on permonance or fixed ? compnesation of the management in the low times should be less compared to high times  
    -remuneration should be acc to MCA limits: 
    -type of stock options :ESOP(not recorded as an expense even though it is)/RSU(preferred as it is recorded an expense)
    Note: make sure to check outstanding shares growth YOY. any company issuing ESOPs abnormally and having a YOY outstanding shares 
    increase > 10%, doesn't care about shareholders
    -if the total outstanding shares are increasing YOY then check if EPS is growing or not (in the same rate or higher than EPS increase)
    -does the Management or Board of directors hold any stocks? if yes then that motivates them to act in favour of shareholders
ETHICS AND INTEGRITY:
    - should do what they say. did they do so? to be found in annual reports(letter to shareholders) & conference calls
    - should be completely transparent to its shareholders, "we don't disclose" is not what we want to hear 
    - should admit the mistakes honestly and take responsibility for their actions
    - should keep shareholders(especially minority shareholders) in mind and work for them instead of personal profits(IMPORTANT)
    - shouldn't be involved in any scams/cases
SKILL AND INTELLIGENCE TEST:
    - skills relevant to industry: Yes/No
    - experience over > 10 yrs : yes (more experience means managers seen boom and burst and knows how to behave in each situation) 
    - mindset/vision: growth and value addition to customers, shareholders wealth creation
    - how are reserves used(IMPORTANT) - bank balance/dividends/buyback/Acquisition/JV with other DCA companies/Reinvesting in your own
     business(capex augumentation/one time capex upgradation/new product launch/spending on technology for achieving efficiency/
     even better is to strengthen its competettive advantage)
    if dividends are paid - shareholders need to pay tax on it
    so better to invest on other DCA businesses or even better is to buyback shares from extra cash as this financial engineering
    concept increases shareholders wealth without paying any tax.
    Note: buying back shares at a premium valuation is not the best use of capital, buying back is useful only if the 
    shares are bought at lower/fair prices.
ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE:
    -ROCE and ROE over last 5yrs/10 yrs ? also consider debt levels (IMPORTANT)
    Note: maintaining consistent ROCE is more imoprtant than EPS growth rate bcoz EPS is influenced by factors like taxes,
      accounting gimmicks etc
DEEP DIVE: 
    - related party transactions: should only be for business purposes(subsidary, JVs etc) and not to executives family or someother unrelated business
    -Board of directors filled with management family members?
    if yes then there is no one to question the management and put the compnay on a winning track
    Note: board of directors is a group of individuals elected to represent shareholders and can question and fire the management
    - CFO /auditor recently resigned/ continously resigning: 
    - shouldn't speak more about share price instead should speak and focus on business in news/annual reports/conf calls:

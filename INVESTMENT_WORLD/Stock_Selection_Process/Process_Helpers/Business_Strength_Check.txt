//Overall requirements to be satisfied by a company
3D Visualisation Mindset: 
  Stock price : you cannot determine what's going on in the business based on share price
  price is what people are ready to pay to acquire/sell a business - you need to decide do you want to participate or stay away
  hence, don't take decision based on Rear view mirror(stock price trend) focus on Business and Valuation(front mirror)
  Note: use share price should be used to determine the gap between intrinsic value and the selling price. 
  INVESTING IS A COMBINATION OF ART + SCIENCE + Legal Work (Kind of Investigative Journalism)

1)BUSINESS(high quality) - think in a way that you will own/buy the entire business and not a single share. understand/analyse the 
  big picture, i.e the macroeconomic picture and oppurtunity and sector growth oppurtunity(keeping in mind global competettion)
  -Predictable and consistent/recurring EARNINGS for next 10 yrs(MOATS, pricing power)
  -Competes on value rather than price bcoz company that competes on value is like a magnet with stronger magnetic field  that
    attracts customers and companies which compete on price will lose their business to competetiors(especially in business that
     generate great returns lot of competetiors will come with a lot of capital to take away the market share and offer less prices)
  -prefer non commoditized business - if commoditized the it must be a low cost producer
  -prefer non-cyclical - if non-cyclical then try enetering at the bottom of the cycle (timing is the key)  
  -lousy industry/highly competettive industry/niche industry(no big players have entered yet) ?
  -proxy play on some capital intensive/debt heavy/lousy industry ? 
  -give high allocation to recession proof stocks(like QSR) , if not how did the company perform during recession years
  -Superior economics (what does company produce, target audience and how does it produce): ESG Principles
   Environmental: does the process/products cause any kind of pollution
   Social: does the products/services add some value to customers or do they waste their time or money or destroy their health
   Governance: Superior Management and board of directors
  -Scalable business model - globally preferred (mutibagger are made because of this property)
  -Company having calibre or potential to adapt to the changing business environment - having said that invest 
    in a business with slow rate of change, rapid change is the enemy of an investor as it needs more capital to adapt and 
    burns more cash to be in the competettion)
  -Having Tailwinds is an added advantage as it boosts the process of wealth creation and helps u in achieving goal faster
  -If a person has lot of money can he break ur business and take away marketshare?
  -Ideal business always takes little amount of capital to operate and an excellent business always
    earns same high returns on incremental capital

 Note: Quality of the business has nothing to do with the size
2)FINANCIAL (last 10 yrs decent financials, if not does it have the potential to generate great financials for the next 10yrs)
As a business owners we are more interested in profitability of the business i.e ROE, ROCE, ROIC, GPM(pricing power),
 OPM(mangement efficiency) and NPM (profitability)
3)MANAGEMENT (high quality management having a long term vision instead of short term profits) 
   No corperate governance issues
   should make the best use of cashflows
   should never hesitate to capture long term oppurtunities by spending on advertising(brand promotion), R&D(innovative products) ,
   capex(infra, upgrading machinery), technolgy(for efficiency) etc as they save taxes in short term and create wealth in the longterm
   and not focus on short term profits(like giving discounts to boost quarterly sales, take debt to buyback shares etc)
4)VALUATION -  Valuation is what differentiates Great Investment from a great business
   we are interested in compounding of company's earnings(cash flow) over the next 10 yrs
   and discount it using current interest rates to derive intrinsic value (how much the business is actually worth today)
  we can pay premium to intrinsic value (but not overpay) for high quality businesses (ROIC > WACC, Moats, longterm Growth runway)
  if you don't find any oppurtunity then invest in Index funds.
  if the company is excellent but available at low valuation - u need to check Why_Stock_Price_Falling.txt
  /why valuation are important?
  if you buy an extraordinary company that is over valued, then it might take a decade for the earnings to catchup to the price
  till then the stock price is not moving anywhere.
  Which means the company will still make money , earnings will grow but your money won't grow, instead u could have kept the money in 
  index funds/liquid debt funds - i.e the oppurtunity cost is much higher
  Note: Be extra careful with innovative/disruptive companies as it is difficult to predict winners and very high risk of new entrants,
  take very high MOS else u might lose capital
5)MARGIN of Safety - for capital protection incase ur assumptions go wrong
  high for Growth companies, low for Value companies - calculating intrinsic value of a company is based on lot of
 assumptions, MOS provides a saftey cover for these assumptions incase they go wrong

Note: Wealth Creation happens when you buy high quality businesses in your circle of competence led by high quality management 
 at margin of safety(or fair price) and hold it for longer periods so that they compound their earnings over time


----------------------- Research Resources ---------------------
//Resources to know about the company/business : 
//Screening
1)screener about and summary sections
2)tijori overview page
3)crisil report and ratings scroll to the end of the page(about company, subsidaries, rating history)
moody's rating for foreign companies
CRISIL Ratings:
A AA AAA (Adequate to highest safety)
B BB BBB (Moderate to high risk)
C (Very high risk)
D (Default)
//Deep Analysis
Must: open RHP for complete information and risks (if a company is recently listed then this must)
1)wikipedia and ticker tape news section
2)company website - most important for updated info 
search about the company or its poducts/services quality in google - you will get customers opinion and any recent developments 
3)company filings(investor presentation, conference calls and annual report(investments, debt sections)) from tijori
4)check for company analysis, business and revenue model in google or youtube

//what peter lynch bucket does stock belongs to?  check share price trend over the years you will get to know
1)slow growers(low risk, low returns)  - the only reason to hold should be dividends
2)stalwarts(low risk, moderate returns) - check if they can maintain the momentum and are getting in to diworsefications?
  companies acquiring market share from organised peers or unorganised peers
3)fast growers(high risk, high returns) :
  can they replicate the growth story somewhere else? e.g cam Matrimony replicate the startegy even in bangladesh(we need to monitor)
  what room is still left for growth?
  emerging tech companies
  companies in emerging industries
4)turnarounds(high risk, high returns)  :
  Special situation: value unlocking via selling off the divisons that are less profitable/sell divisons in highly
  competettive industry OR increase the efficiency of the process/divisons by cost cutting and technology upgradation etc, which will
  translate them to low cost producer/promoter change
  value unlocking(highly profitable companies getting demerged from conglomerates e.g: ITC Infotech, ITC FMCG demerger from ITC group
  sleeping gaints awakened  - what road map does the company have from loss to profits (VI, IDFC FIRST BANK, TATA CONSUMER)
  ignored companies that have very strong growth potential in the future
Note: don't buy a turnaround just because stock price is down, own it if business is starting to pickup, financials are great etc
5)cyclicals(high risk, low returns or low risk high returns depending upon the cycle at which u have invested) - the more things 
  are stressed the better will be the recovery
  //Always prefer non cyclical or least cyclical
  cyclical + high fixed cost => DANGER as debt levels will be high, e.g: Airlines
  Also during inflation if there is no pricing power for the company - then it will be a disaster for shareholders
  Note: Timing is everything in cyclicals
6)asset plays(low risk, high returns) - price vs value play (balance sheet scanning is must)
   hidden assets(like extrememly profitable subsidaries or divisons) like ITC
   natural resources like land, real estate,gold, oil or cash etc in high amounts? where the value of these exceeds the stock price
   patience is the key here because it might take years for wall street to discover these gems and re-rate the stock
   check price to book value

Note: 
--companies keep shifting the buckets like fast growers can become slow growers or slow growers can become cyclicals
--cyclicals can become turarounds
--stalwarts like MCD can become asset plays bcoz of the real estate it owns
--growth expectation should not be the same for all the categories stocks alike

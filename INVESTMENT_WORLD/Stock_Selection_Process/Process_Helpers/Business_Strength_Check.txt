//Overall requirements to be satisfied by a company
3D Visualisation Mindset: 
  Stock price : you cannot determine what's going on in the business based on share price
  price is what people are ready to pay to acquire/sell a business - you need to decide do you want to participate or stay away
  hence, don't take decision based on Rear view mirror(stock price trend) focus on Business and Valuation(front mirror)
  Note: use share price should be used to determine the gap between intrinsic value and the selling price. 
  INVESTING IS A COMBINATION OF ART + SCIENCE + Legal Work

1)BUSINESS(high quality) - think in a way that you will own/buy the entire business and not a single share. understand/analyse the 
  big picture, i.e the macroeconomic picture and oppurtunity and sector growth oppurtunity(keeping in mind global low cost imports)
  -Predictable and consistent/recurring EARNINGS for next 10 yrs(MOATS, pricing power)
  -Competes on value rather than price bcoz company that competes on value is like a magnet with stronger magnetic field  that
    attracts customers and companies which compete on price will lose their business to competetiors
  -prefer high margin non commoditized business - if commoditized then must be a low cost producer
  -Superior economics (what does company produce, target audience and how does it produce): ESG Principles
   Environmental: does the process/products cause any kind of pollution
   Social: does the products/services add some value to customers or do they waste their time or money or destroy their health
   Governance: Superior Management and board of directors
  -Scalable business model - globally preferred (mutibagger are made because of this property)
  -Company having calibre or potential to adapt to the changing business environment - having said that invest 
    in a business with slow rate of change, rapid change is the enemy of an investor as it needs more capital to adapt and 
    burns more cash to be in the competettion)
  -if someone has more money than the business owner can he come and replace the business by giving incentives to customers
     and take away the market share?
  -Having Tailwinds is an added advantage as it boosts the process of wealth creation and helps u in achieving goal faster
 Note: Quality of the business has nothing to do with the size
2)FINANCIAL (last 10 yrs decent financials, if not does it have the potential to generate great financials for the next 10yrs)
As a business owners we are more interested in profitability of the business i.e ROE, ROCE, ROIC, GPM(pricing power),
 OPM(mangement efficiency) and NPM (profitability)
3)MANAGEMENT (high quality management having a long term vision instead of short term profits) 
   No corperate governance issues
   should make the best use of cashflows
   should never hesitate to capture long term oppurtunities by spending on advertising(brand promotion), R&D(innovative products) ,
   capex(infra, upgrading machinery), technolgy(for efficiency) etc as they save taxes in short term and create wealth in the longterm
   and not focus on short term profits(like giving discounts to boost quarterly sales, take debt to buyback shares etc)
4)VALUATION - how much the business is actually worth, i.e we are interested in compounding of company's earnings over the next 10 yrs
   and discount it using current interest rates to derive intrinsic value
  we can pay premium to intrinsic value (but not overpay) for high quality businesses - if you don't find any oppurtunity then invest in Index funds.
  if the company is excellent but available at low valuation - u need to check Why_Stock_Price_Falling.txt
  /why valuation are important?
  if you buy an extraordinary company that is over valued, then it might take a decade for the earnings to catchup to the price
  till then the stock price is not moving anywhere.
  Which means the company will still make money , earnings will grow but your money won't grow, instead u could have kept the money in 
  index funds/liquid debt funds - i.e the oppurtunity cost is much higher
  Note: Be extra careful with innovative/disruptive companies as it is difficult to predict winners and very high risk of new entrants,
  take very high MOS else u might lose capital
5)MARGIN of Safety - for capital protection incase ur assumptions go wrong
  high for Growth companies, low for Value companies - calculating intrinsic value of a company is based on lot of
 assumptions, MOS provides a saftey cover for these assumptions incase they go wrong

Note: Wealth Creation happens when you buy high quality businesses in your circle of competence led by high quality management 
 at margin of safety(or fair price) and hold it for longer periods so that they compound their earnings over time


----------------------- PAST: company Background and Past performance ---------------------
---why did the promoters start business (family legacy/passion/strategic importance to other companies) - PASSION clearly wins

---Resources to know about the  company/business : 
1)wikipedia
2)company website - most important for updated info 
search about the company or its poducts/services quality in google - you will get customers opinion and any recent developments 
3)screener summary
5)tijori overview page
5)crisil report and ratings scroll to the end of the page(about company, subsidaries, rating history)
CRISIL Ratings:
A AA AAA (Adequate to highest safety)
B BB BBB (Moderate to high risk)
C (Very high risk)
D (Default)
6)company filings(investor presentation, conference calls and annual report(investments, debt sections)) from tijori


---Stock research report sources:
https://www.moneycontrol.com/equity-research/category-stock-reports
https://www.valueresearchstocks.com/recos-current
https://www.moneycontrol.com/equity-research/stock-recommendations-active

---what peter lynch bucket does stock belongs to?  check share price trend over the years you will get to know
1)slow growers(low risk, low returns)  - the only reason to hold should be dividends
2)stalwarts(low risk, moderate returns) - check if they can maintain the momentum and are getting in to diworsefications?
  companies acquiring market share from organised peers or unorganised peers
3)fast growers(high risk, high returns) :
  can they replicate the growth story somewhere else? e.g cam Matrimony replicate the startegy even in bangladesh(we need to monitor)
  what room is still left for growth?
  emerging tech companies
  companies in emerging industries
4)turnarounds(high risk, high returns)  - value unlocking via selling off the divisons that are less profitable/sell divisons in highly
  competettive industry OR increase the efficiency of the process/divisons by cost cutting and technology upgradation etc, which will
  translate them to low cost producer.
  value unlocking(highly profitable companies getting demerged from conglomerates e.g: ITC Infotech, ITC FMCG demerger from ITC group
  sleeping gaints awakened  - what road map does the company have from loss to profits (VI, IDFC FIRST BANK, TATA CONSUMER)
  ignored companies that have very strong growth potential in the future
Note: don't buy a turnaround just because stock price is down, own it if business is starting to pickup, financials are great etc
5)cyclicals(high risk, low returns or low risk high returns depending upon the cycle at which u have invested) - the more things 
  are stressed the better will be the recovery
  //Always prefer non cyclical or least cyclical
  cyclical + high fixed cost => DANGER as debt levels will be high, e.g: Airlines
  Also during inflation if there is no pricing power for the company - then it will be a disaster for shareholders
  Note: Timing is everything in cyclicals
6)asset plays(low risk, high returns) - price vs value play (balance sheet scanning is must)
   hidden assets(like extrememly profitable subsidaries or divisons) like ITC
   natural resources like land, real estate,gold, oil or cash etc in high amounts? where the value of these exceeds the stock price
   patience is the key here because it might take years for wall street to discover these gems and re-rate the stock
   check price to book value

Note: 
--companies keep shifting the buckets like fast growers can become slow growers or slow growers can become cyclicals
--cyclicals can become turarounds
--stalwarts like MCD can become asset plays bcoz of the real estate it owns
--growth expectation should not be the same for all the categories stocks alike


--------------------------------------- PRESENT ----------------------------------------
---Sectoral analysis:
//Information Source: 
check sector_summary folder (from morning star analysts)
https://www.ibef.org/industry.aspx - reports
you will get information about a sector in the Annual Report(MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS REPORT)
https://www.sebi.gov.in/sebiweb/home/HomeAction.do?doListing=yes&sid=3&ssid=15&smid=11 - SEBI IPO filings (industry overview),
https://www.tijorifinance.com/company/marico-limited/#knowledgebase - industry
https://www.tijorifinance.com/sector/banking - sector

//STAGE of development:
pioneering - EV, green energy
growth - internet
maturity/saturation - FMCG
declining - obselete - TV channels, print media

//Sector value chain : from sourcing to sales entire process and businesses involved must be known (you should always pick companies 
at profitable end of value chain)

//Market size/Oppurtunity or possible demand for the Sector: it is not about how big a company is, it is about how big a company can get
   only within the country :
        limited to few businesses/limited customer usage
        not limited to a single user (almost every user will find its usage now or eventually)
        not limited to single business (almost every business will find its usage now or eventually)
   global oppurtunity/exports :
        limited to few businesses/limited customer usage
        not limited to a single user (almost every user will find its usage now or eventually)
        not limited to single business (almost every business will find its usage now or eventually)

---Products/services DEMAND check :
//From where does the actual demand from for the company? 
  B2B (client diversification, strong order book - must be volume led growth)
  B2C (how many users out of 140 cr population use it)
  Business service companies (what all industries/companies need it)
  Government
  Global - from which all countries demand come from

//Type of demand
    Infrastructure/Platform - repeat usage including subscripton models
    continous and constant/slow growth demand(FMCG, Food)
    continous and growing demand - volume led growth reaching to larger audience or more consumption(personal care, healthcare, 
       insurnace, real estate, home furnishing, Energy,Banking and finance)
    continous and replacement/upgradation demand based on latest trends/depreciation - value addition (clothing and footwear, 
        Electronics, Automobile, Telecommunication)
    one time demand(capital goods) then growth oppurtunities size should be vast like Praj.Even though Praj establishes the ethanol
     plant, it has huge oppurtunity abroad/huge order backlog both domestic and abroad
    Transition Demand - EV, Renewable Energy, 5G, New Technology - need a lot of research as it can make or break your portfolio

//Capturing sector demand Oppurtunities:
sector demand is growing like Telecom, aviation : even if the company retains its market share and can sustain over the years 
  it can grow effortlessly
sector demand constant like FMCG :  company needs to capture market share from others by providing unique products or enetring in to 
   other FMCG verticals where the company is not even present

---Products/services SUPPLY check :
1)product portfolio - what all products company manufactures (you can find in investor presentation) - check revenue contribution 
  of each product
Note: if you are investing in this company only because of a specific product like chawyan prash(dabur), Royal enfield(Eicher) etc
always check wt % revenues are contributed by that product (for Eicher RE contributes around 90% revenues so it can be a buy based
 on further analysis but Dabur cannot be a buy based on chawayan prash because it contibutes < 10% to revenue)
e.g: tatva chintan has a huge portfolio and electrolytic salts to be used in EV is roughly 5% of their portfolio - so don't invest
  only based on EV exposure


2)COMPETETION: Never look for companies that doesn't have competetion, always prefer companies that sustained competettion with their 
             MOATS bcoz someday or the other competettion is bound to come if it is a high margin business. At the same time Never 
             invest in a business that is present in a highly competettive industry that competes ONLY on price instead of value
  what is the unlisted players market share - 
  listed peers market share -
  postion among peers - 
  global competettion - imports risk from china or any other low cost producer country?
  threat of new entrants
Note: 
 if a business is extremely profitable then it attracts lot of capital , hence taking away gains/market share (so MOAT check is imp)
 if a business is dull/not profitable then lot of capital goes away => current company that survives or control expenses will keep
 gaining market share and eventually turns profitable (keep an eye)


3)Listed peers Comparison: tijori(benchmark) and screener peer comparison sections for profitability and costs
how do peers provide competetion : strong moats/geographical expansion/innovative products/capex spending
Pro Tip: if all Peers are equally profitable and equally effecient then low WC/sales(less capital needed to generate sales) and
  low CCC(less time taken to generate profits) is preferred


4)Products/services Uniqueness and Quality check :
what makes the product or service of this company Unique?
  //does it delight the customers - when they don't find that product in a store will they go across the street to get it
  //does it own consumers mind(i.e people always remember this company when u talk about a specific product like drink,burger,choc etc)
  //what value does it add to customers compared to competetiors?


--------------------------------------- FUTURE ----------------------------------------
---Goal/Aim that the company wants to achieve and what is the Strategy that it wants to employ?
//Goal/Aim - global leader, capture market share from unorganised/organised players, cleanup stuff and become efficient etc
//Strategies being employed: 
ideally a company that clones other successful strategies is almost bound to win provided it has other necessary qualifications

//how is the Management and their Vision:
Ideally we should invest in a business which even a fool can run because someday or the other a fool does - Warren Buffet
and then if u put a capable and passionate management he will do wonders for you

---------------- EARNING POWER (Earnings Growth Oppurtunities check ) ----------------
Earning Power is the ability of the company to grow or compound its earnings every year (in the worst case keep it constant but
  then its better to hold bonds for more predicitability)

---SOURCE OF EARNINGS: earnings source is more than earnings itself bcoz earnings source decides whether the earning growth is 
      sustainable or not, i.e it decides quality of earnings
Company earnings can come from Internal Growth (sales growth/efficiency) OR External growth(acquisitions) OR Both


i)INTERNAL GROWTH OPPURTUNITIES
///Sales Growth led Earnings Growth(every firm needs this kind of growth)     
  1)Demand/Consumption led growth from NEW customers (Volume led growth)
    /Acquire new customers in untapped and rural areas
    /Acquire customers from competetiors by taking away their market share (does capex to service the demand)
    /import substitution (Atam nirbhar bharat)
    /Global expansion/ exports - Launch products in new markets
    /it is in a NON Growth/dull sector but company keeps growing by capturing market share from other organised/unorganised players
    /Strong Order inflows (only for B2B companies)
    /Demand shift from other countries like (china+1 startegy, supplychain disruption in other countries,for low cost substitution
       products etc - but be careful here as they can move from India to someother country too) 
  2)Demand/Consumption led growth from OLD customers (Volume led growth)
    /volume led growth - cutomers buy more of the current/old products
    /Launch New products - capex and manufacture new products(innovated products/refurbised products) and selling them to old
      customers at high prices
    Note: mode of capex funding is also important: preference cash>debt>equity
  3)ONLY Price led Growth (Not preferred at all) - slow growers(very large and matured companies)
    /Increase the price of old product, but increase in volume -  if volumes don't increase after some years your company earnings
    growth rate = inflation(6%) and in the long run as the stock price depends ONLY on earnings, it will also grow at 6%, meaning ur 
    money also grows at 6% and the purpose of investing in stock markets to beat infalation is gone. Also if sales are not increasing 
    then demand has dried up OR competetiors taking away market share - Both are bad situations
    4)MISC:
    /Innovation led growth - either in process or the product
    /Accounting tricks/fraud(increased other income, lower amort and dep charges)
    /promoter OR management change
///Efficiency led Earnings Growth(few firms have achieved it, they just need to maintain)
    /cost cutting(cannot cut cost beyond a certain point) - increasing operating efficiency and hence margins
    //spending on technology for achieving efficiency and modernising the workflow or processes
    /spin off - dispose losing operations (increases firm efficiency by increasing management focus)
    /organisational restructure - dispose or divest low profit/non-core businesses from the firm
    /Reduce debt - look at D/E trend over 10yrs and Debt/Profit should be less than 5
    NOTE: This form of growth will increase profitability of the firm in the short term, but a company cannot become efficient 
    after a certain point(even though it can maintain that efficiency) hence for the profitability to sustain in the longterm this
    needs to be augumented by Demand/consumption led growth either from New or Old customers(Preferably from new customers)
    But in the journey of company becoming efficient you can make huge profits and hence always check whether management is focusing
    on making the firm efficient or not apart from focusing on sales

ii)EXTERNAL: GROWTH OPPURTUNITIES
  /cloning other great company strategies
  /Acquistion and synergy led growth(Acquistion for strategic purpose(augumenting existing business like acquiring firm that supplies
    key raw materials, firm that has excellent technology and skilled manpower, firm that has reputation globally and is present in 
    areas where the current firm doesn't OR in simple words acquire any firm that adds value by doing something which the current 
    firm doesn't OR any firm that increases the efficieny of the current firm operations) 
  /vertical integration - zero dependence on others, high avialbility, cost advantage and quality control e.g: Apple, Amazon
  /process optimisation and innovation - chemicals and pharma mainly
  /backward and forward integration
  /it is in a growing sector with tailwinds - every company in the sector will grow like Indian IT companies, chemicals etc
  /support from govt - relief packages etc - (not preferred if relief is for short term)

Note: Internal growth is always preferred but sometimes the business size is so big that the size of internal growth oppurtunity 
   seems trivial and we need to opt for external growth. 
   for e.g: let us say if HUL identifies an internal growth oppurtunity that can increase its cash flow by 20% , however if HUL 
   opts and invests the capital in external growth oppurtunity instead, say acquisition then its cashflow grows by 50% then it
   is a no brainer to allocate capital for external growth opportunity by the Management


------ Sustainability of Earning power: MOATS and Pricing Power to make it a long term bet -------
1)Competettive advantage/MOAT Check? - company might not be a market leader but it should have some advantage over competetiors(MOAT)
 that puts them far ahead of the competettion and make it sustain for a longterm
  Does MOAT Exists? check MOATS_check.txt
  if yes is the MOAT durable, i.e can the company keep its DCA nature for next 10 yrs OR will competetiors snatch away 
   the profits? Imagine and think with a calm mind where do you see this company in the next 10 yrs,
    take in to account, facts and reasoning not opinion
  if NO MOAT what is the 10 yr picture u have in ur mind? will it build one?
  monopoly or duopoly(monopoly might not create wealth everytime be careful with these companies if a competettion comes in and 
   takes away the profit they will bust you However that doesn't happen overnight, it will be gradually reflected in the earnings
   so doing an annual review should catch these stuff)
Note: even though company has a MOAT, you always need to have the guard(YOU) inspect the castle anually because MOATS could 
   have been broken or there is something else that went wrong (weak growth oppurtunities, substitutes, bad management, costly
   acquistions)

2)PRICING POWER (MUST HAVE MOAT)- are people ready to pay premium (can the compnay increase the product/services prices in the cases
 like inflation and supply chain disruption or in general and be sure that people still buy their products and they don't loose their 
 business to competettion) proof: sales trend is upwards and Net profit Margin trend is either stable or upwards(tijori)
 This will happen only when :
   i)The product or service is unique and there is hardly any substitute
   ii)Intensity of competetion is low(preferred) OR super efficient business where intensity of competetion is high 
   iii)NO bargaining power of suppliers: suppliers shouldn't have more bargaining power, if they have then better to own the supplier stocks
     Bargining power of suppliers(low or -ve accounts payable) - critical parts/services suppliers, ONLY producer/supplier of certain products
     Bargining power of company(-ve working capital) - bulk and recurring buy, company with MOATS (as the demand is sustainable)
    Note: Account payables 
   iv)NO bargaining power of buyers :
     Bargaining power of buyers(higher inventory days as people always look for bargain in other places, high account recievables as
     the company needs to give the product on credit ) - if client base is limited then company doesn't have a choice but to sell 
     the products at a lower price, if the buyer demands so, especially true for B2B suppliers OR a company in a highly competettive
     business (e-commerce, airlines) where people never want to pay premium OR if the product is a commodity (then people always 
     look for low price as value is same across producers)
Note: Pricing power is must for capex heavy companies and companies with large amounts of debt - otherwise they can go Bankruptcy
  and destroy shareholder's wealth during recession

3) Longterm vs short term bet
/Preferred Investment: Both MOATS and Earnings Growth oppurtunities need to exist for sustainable Earnings
/Company with No Moats  but very high growth oppurtunities - a short term buy becuase other competetiors with MOATS can take away the
market share soon - need to monitor closely
/Company with good MOATS but not very good growth oppurtunities - it has become a slow grower(if they genrate a stable free cashflow
you can use the cash to buy other growth and non-growth businesses) 
Note: Don't forget to compare dividend yield with FD interest rates

------------------ Capital Allocation ----------------
---SOURCE OF CAPITAL : 
EPS = Net Income(earnings)/Total Shares outstanding
1)RETAINED EARNINGS(cheapest and most preferred) - i.e reinvest free cashflow generated by the company
+ve scenario: Earnings increase => EPS increases => share price increases
-ve scenario: you will lose Reserves, but your Earnings will remain same => EPS remains same => share price remains constant
most importantly it doesn't have to pay any interest , also the total number of shares outstanding doesn't change
Hence a company needs to do some experimentation with the products/geography or try something new it is preferred to use RETAINED EARNINGS
2)DEBT(next preference)
+ve scenario: Earnings increase => debt repaid => after repayment whatever company acquired using debt(brand value, building, plant 
  and machinery) will remian with the company and fetch cash forever
-ve scenario: if debt levels are very high and Earnings decrease because of no pricing power ,company need to sell assets and 
 repay debt => Bankruptcy
3)NEW EQUITY(EPS will decrease) - ESOPs, Preferential issue, QIP, Private placement etc
+ve scenario: new equity raised is used in the best way possible (reinvesting in own buiness/M&A) => Earnings increase => EPS increase
  and hence share price increases
-ve scenario: Earnings decrease and Total Shares outstanding increases, EPS goes down and  hence share prices crash


---RETURN ON CAPITAL:
Good company: ROCE/ROIC(return on capital) > WACC (cost of cpital)
Very Good company : ROCE/ROIC(return on capital) >>> WACC (cost of cpital)
Ideal company : if it can redeploy the incremental capital for same/high returns over time - it becomes a compounding machine
Note: there are a very few companies that does this
Hence better to take out the cash from such companies and use it acquire other businesses, if u redeploy the incremental
  capital in a business where there are no growth oppurtunities to use that capital then its returns get hampered - exactly to avoid 
  such case most FMCG companies distribute their profits as dividends


---USE OF NEW/INCREMENTAL CAPITAL : A good company always uses capital for achieving operating efficiency or focus on next phase
 growth and not for survival 
Cash - waiting for oppurtunities
Organic growth - putting back the money in the same business like meaningful expenses provided you maintain your return ratios(ROE/ROCE/ROIC)
Inorganic growth - M&A for strategic purpose or to build a MOAT
Dividends
Buyback - preferred
Capex - new
Capex - old PLANT/MACHINERY maintainance (this can't be for ever year meaning sustainence capex is bad for the company)
operating efficiency - modernising or technology upgradation of operations
R&D
Advertising
Working capital (tied up in) - bad

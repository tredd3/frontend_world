//overall requirements to be satisfied by a company
BUSINESS + FINANCIAL +  Management + VALUATION (all are equally important) + Margin of safety(for growth companies,
fair price for Value companies)
decision ONLY  based on facts(news, reports) and reasoning(think, compare), not on opinion and emotions
Provide Continuous fuel and efficiency to the process: keep updated with present knowledge
//why valuation are important?
if you buy an extraordinary company that is over valued, then it might take a decade for the earnings to catchup to the price
till then the stock price is not moving anywhere.
Which means the company will still make money , earnings will grow but your money won't grow, instead u could have kept the money in 
index funds/liquid debt funds


----------------------- PAST: company Background and Past performance ---------------------
---why did the promoters start business (family legacy/passion/strategic importance to other companies) - PASSION clearly wins

---Resources to know about the  company/business : 
1)wikipedia
2)company website - most important for updated info 
3)screener summary
5)tijori overview page
5)crisil report and ratings scroll to the end of the page(about company, subsidaries, rating history)
CRISIL Ratings:
A AA AAA (Adequate to highest safety)
B BB BBB (Moderate to high risk)
C (Very high risk)
D (Default)
6)company filings(investor presentation, conference calls and annual report(investments, debt sections)) from tijori

https://www.moneycontrol.com/equity-research/stock-recommendations-active

---what peter lynch bucket does stock belongs to?  check share price trend over the years you will get to know
1)slow growers(low risk, low returns)  - the only reason to hold should be dividends
2)stalwarts(low risk, moderate returns) - check if they can maintain the momentum and are getting in to diworsefications?
  companies acquiring market share from organised peers or unorganised peers
3)fast growers(high risk, high returns) :
  can they replicate the growth story somewhere else? e.g cam Matrimony replicate the startegy even in bangladesh(we need to monitor)
  what room is still left for growth?
  emerging tech companies
  companies in emerging industries
4)turnarounds(high risk, high returns)  - value unlocking via selling off the divisons that are less profitable/sell divisons in highly
  competettive industry OR increase the efficiency of the process/divisons by cost cutting and technology upgradation etc, which will
  translate them to low cost producer.
  value unlocking(highly profitable companies getting demerged from conglomerates e.g: ITC Infotech, ITC FMCG demerger from ITC group
  sleeping gaints awakened  - what road map does the company have from loss to profits (VI, IDFC FIRST BANK, TATA CONSUMER)
  ignored companies that have very strong growth potential in the future
Note: don't buy a turnaround just because stock price is down, own it if business is starting to pickup, financials are great etc
5)cyclicals(high risk, low returns or low risk high returns depending upon the cycle at which u have invested) - the more things 
  are stressed the better will be the recovery
  //Always prefer non cyclical or least cyclical
  cyclical + high fixed cost => DANGER as debt levels will be high, e.g: Airlines
  Note: Timing is everything in cyclicals
6)asset plays(low risk, high returns) - price vs value play (balance sheet scanning is must)
   hidden assets(like extrememly profitable subsidaries or divisons) like ITC
   natural resources like land, real estate,gold, oil or cash etc in high amounts? where the value of these exceeds the stock price
   patience is the key here because it might take years for wall street to discover these gems and re-rate the stock

Note: 
--companies keep shifting the buckets like fast growers can become slow growers or slow growers can become cyclicals
--cyclicals can become turarounds
--stalwarts like MCD can become asset plays bcoz of the real estate it owns
--growth expectation should not be the same for all the categories stocks alike

---Sectoral analysis:
//Information Source: 
check sector_summary folder (from morning star analysts)

you will get information about a sector in the Annual Report(MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS REPORT)
https://www.sebi.gov.in/sebiweb/home/HomeAction.do?doListing=yes&sid=3&ssid=15&smid=11 - SEBI IPO filings (industry overview),

https://www.tijorifinance.com/sector/banking - sector
//STAGE of development:
pioneering - EV, green energy
growth - internet
maturity/saturation - FMCG
decling - obselete - TV channels, print media
//Sector value chain : from sourcing to sales entire process and businesses involved must be known (you should always pick companies 
at profitable end of value chain) demand and supply (size of opportunity)
 

---Products/services DEMAND check :
//From where does the demand come? 
  B2B supplier (client diversification, strong order book - must be volume led growth)
  B2C (are the products frequently used by each and every individual, creating high demand)?  
    Reason: strong demand => supply increases => revenue increases => EPS increases => share price increase => your money grows)
  Business service companies (almost every business should find its usage now or eventually)
//Type of demand
    Infrastructure/Platform - repeat usage including subscripton models
    continous and growing demand - volume led growth reaching to larger audience(personal care, healthcare, insurnace, 
      real estate, home furnishing, Energy,Banking and finance)
    continous and replacement/upgradation demand based on latest trends/depreciation - value addition (clothing and footwear, 
    Electronics, Automobile, Telecommunication)
    continous and constant/slow growth demand(FMCG, Food)
    one time demand(capital goods) then growth oppurtunities size should be vast like Praj.Even though Praj establishes the ethanol
     plant, it has huge oppurtunity abroad/huge order backlog both domestic and abroad
    Transition Demand - EV, Renewable Energy, 5G, New Technology - need a lot of research as it can make or break your portfolio
//Market size/Oppurtunity:
   limited to few businesses
   limited customer usage 
   within the country
   global oppurtunity/exports


---Products/services SUPPLY check :
product diversification - what all products company manufactures (you can find in investor presentation)
prefer high margin non commoditized business - if commoditized then must be a low cost producer
check market share trend over the years in tijori - to know how much demand is being catered by the company 
  Also to know if the company is losing the business to competetiors
Is there any peer whose market share is higher than the current company? - great way to find a excellent competetior business
can company's business/products/services be replaced/substituted by new age technology/innovative products/services?
Competettion: 
  what is the unlisted players market share?
  listed peers - tijori(benchmark) and screener peer comparison sections for profitability and costs
  global competettion - imports risk from china or any other low cost producer country?
  threat of new entrants
how do peers provide competetion : strong moats/geographical expansion/innovative products/capex spending
POSITION IN PEERS :

--- Products/services Uniqueness check :
what makes the product or service of this company Unique?
  //does it delight the customers - when they don't find that product in a store will they go across the street to get it
  //does it own consumers mind(i.e people always remember this company when u talk about a specific product like drink,burger,choc etc)
  //what value does it add to customers?
  //how is the quality of product/service - Have u used the product/service ? 
    if YES, what is your view 
    if NO, go and open their website, check public review in ecommerce or google search
Note: if you are investing in this company only because of a specific product like chawyan prash(dabur), Royal enfield(Eicher) etc
always check wt % revenues are contributed by that product (for Eicher RE contributes around 90% revenues so it can be a buy based
 on further analysis but Dabur cannot be a buy based on chawayan prash because it contibutes < 10% to revenue)


--------------------------------------- FUTURE ----------------------------------------
---Process/Strategy check?
//do you know market leader success and failures stories? if yes apply then to the current company process/strategy
//how is the Management and their Vision:
Ideally we should onvest in a business which even a fool can run because someday or the other 
a fool does - Warren Buffet
check Management_Check.txt


--- Sustainabile Growth of Earnings check :
//Competettive advantage/MOAT Check? - company might not be a market leader but it should have some advantage(MOAT) that put them far
   ahead of the competettion and make it sustain for a longterm
  Does MOAT Exists? check MOATS_check.txt
  if yes is the MOAT durable, i.e can the company keep its DCA nature for next 10 yrs OR will competetiors snatch away 
   the profits? Imagine and think with a calm mind where do you see this company in the next 10 yrs,
    take in to account, facts and reasoning not opinion
  if NO MOAT what is the 10 yr picture u have in ur mind? will it build one?
  monopoly or duopoly
Note: even though company has a MOAT, you always need to have the guard(YOU) inspect the castle anually because MOATS could 
   have been broken or there is something else that went wrong (weak growth oppurtunities, substitutes, bad management, costly
   acquistions)

//PRICING POWER - are people ready to pay premium (can the compnay increase the product/services prices in the cases like inflation 
and supply chain disruption or in general and be sure that people still buy their products and they don't loose their business to 
competettion) proof: sales trend is upwards and Net profit Margin trend is either stable or upwards(tijori)
 This will happen only when :
   i)The product or service is unique
   ii)company has a MOAT
   iii)NO bargaining power of suppliers: suppliers shouldn't have more bargaining power, if they have then better to own the supplier stocks
     Bargining power of suppliers - critical parts/services suppliers, ONLY producer/supplier of certain products
     Bargining power of company - bulk and recurring buy, company with MOATS 
   iv)NO bargaining power of buyers :
     Bargaining power of buyers - if client base is limited then company doesn't have a choice but to sell the products at a lower 
     price, if the buyer demands so, especially true for B2B suppliers OR a company in a highly competettive business (e-commerce)
     OR if the product is a commodity (then people always look for low price as value is same across producers)


//Growth potential/Oppurtunities ?
---SOURCE OF CAPITAL : 
EPS = Net Income(earnings)/Total Shares outstanding
1)RETAINED EARNINGS(cheapest and most preferred)
+ve scenario: Earnings increase => EPS increases => share price increases
-ve scenario: you will lose Reserves, but your Earnings will remian same => EPS remians same => share price remains constant
most importantly it doesn't have to pay any interest , also the total number of shares outstanding doesn't change
Hence a company needs to do some experimentation with the products/geography or try something new it is preferred to use RETAINED EARNINGS
2)DEBT(next preference)
+ve scenario: Earnings increase => debt repaid => after repayment whatever company acquired using debt(brand value, building, plant 
  and machinery) will remian with the company and fetch cash forever
-ve scenario: if debt levels are very high and Earnings decrease,company need to sell assets and repay debt => Bankruptcy
3)NEW EQUITY(EPS will decrease)
+ve scenario: new equity raised is used in the best way possible (reinvesting in own buiness/M&A) => Earnings increase => EPS increase
  and hence share price increases
-ve scenario: Earnings decrease and Total Shares outstanding increases, EPS goes down and  hence share prices crash
Note: if new equity can be used very efficiently then this will have a greater preferrence over debt as u don't have to payback


---SOURCE OF EARNINGS: earnings source is more than earnings itself bcoz earnings source decides whether the earning growth is 
      sustainable or not
Logic: Your money of shareholder increases if share price increases.share price in the lonterm depends ONLY on Earnings,Earnings and Earnings
Earnings can come from =>  Sales led Growth OR Company Synergy and Efficiency led growth OR BOTH(need to pick such companies)
Pro Tip: if all Peers are equally profitable and equally effiecient then low WC/sales(less capital needed to generate sales) and
  low CCC(less time taken to generate profits) is preferred

// Sales led Growth (every firm needs this kind of growth)     
  1)Demand/Consumption led growth from NEW customers (Volume led growth)
    /Acquire new customers in untapped and rural areas
    /Acquire customers from competetiors by taking away their market share (does capex to service the demand)
    /import substitution (Atam nirbhar bharat)
    /Global expansion/ exports - Launch products in new markets
    /it is in a NON Growth/dull sector but company keeps growing by capturing market share from other organised/unorganised players
    /Strong Order inflows (only for B2B companies)
    /Demand shift from other countries like (china+1 startegy, supplychain disruption in other countries,for low cost substitution
       products etc - but be careful here as they can move from India to someother country too) 
  2)Demand/Consumption led growth from OLD customers (Volume led growth)
    /volume led growth - cutomers buy more of the current/old products
    /Launch New products - capex and manufacture new products(innovated products/refurbised products) and selling them to old
      customers at high prices
  3)ONLY Price led Growth (Not preferred at all)
    /Increase the price of old product, but increase in volume -  if volumes don't increase after some years your company earnings
    growth rate = inflation(6%) and in the long run as the stock price depends ONLY on earnings, it will also grow at 6%, meaning ur 
    money also grows at 6% and the purpose of investing in stock markets to beat infalation is gone. Also if sales are not increasing 
    then demand has dried up OR competetiors taking away market share - Both are bad situations
// Company Synergy and Efficiency led growth (few firms have achieved it, they just need to maintain)
    /cost cutting(cannot cut cost beyond a certain point) - increasing operating efficiency and hence margins
    //spending on technology for achieving efficiency and modernising the workflow or processes
    /dispose losing operations (increases firm efficiency by increasing management focus)
    /Acquistion and synergy led growth(Acquistion for strategic purpose(augumenting existing business like acquiring firm that supplies
    key raw materials, firm that has excellent technology and skilled manpower, firm that has reputation globally and is present in 
    areas where the current firm doesn't OR in simple words acquire any firm that adds value by doing something which the current 
    firm doesn't OR any firm that increases the efficieny of the current firm operations) 
    /vertical integration - zero dependence on others, high avialbility, cost advantage and quality control e.g: Apple, Amazon
    /Reduce debt - look at D/E trend over 10yrs and Debt/Profit should be less than 5

    NOTE: This form of growth will increase profitability of the firm in the short term, but a company cannot become efficient 
    after a certain point(even though it can maintain that efficiency) hence for the profitability to sustain in the longterm this
    needs to be augumented by Demand/consumption led growth either from New or Old customers(Preferably from new customers)
    But in the journey of company becoming efficient you can make huge profits and hence always check whether management is focusing
    on making the firm efficient or not apart from focusing on sales
// Other Ways (Misc)
  /it is in a growing sector with tailwinds - every company in the sector will grow like Indian IT companies
  /support from govt - relief packages etc - (not preferred if relief is for short term)
  /Accounting tricks/fraud(increased other income, lower amort and dep charges)
  /promoter OR management change

Note: Both Growth MOATS and Growth oppurtunities need to exist else earnings are not sustainable
Company with No Moats  but very high growth oppurtunities - a short term buy becuase other competetiors with MOATS can take away the
market share soon - need to monitor closely
company with good MOATS but not very good growth oppurtunities - it has become a slow grower(if you have lot of money u can invest
 here if not search for stalwarts or fast growers)

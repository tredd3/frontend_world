----------------------------------- Financial strength check -----------------------------
GOLDEN RULES: 
1)consistency of financials for last 10 yrs is what we need to check and not 1-2 yrs
2)financials always give you an idea of the company's past and present scenario(Rear View),
 but you need to own the company because of its future prospects which depends on MOATS, Growth oppurtunities and Management ability
 to capture such oppurtunities.
Remember: you can't drive a car by looking in the rear mirror, u need to look forward(i.e future in case of companies)


----------BALANCE SHEET (Assets)---------
--current assets > current liabilities ?
Note: some DCA companies might not have CA>CL but their earning power and DCA helps them sail through

--cash & bank balances increasing? 
is the cash generated bcoz of operations? 
what % of reserves is cash?
compare cash with long term debt and not reserves with longterm debt because reserves might be locked in other investments 
  which might not be liquid(if longterm debt > cash check if net profit /free cash flow of next 4 yrs can service entire longterm debt)
we are not considering short term debt will be taken by current assets(excluding cash & bank balance)
Note: check last 10yrs balance sheet to find out

--check cash/market_cap :
if significant i.e > 0.3 then calculate cash per share
steps:
1)total cash: cash & bank balances + short term investments
2)net cash = total cash - long term debt
3)CASH PER SHARE = (net cash * share price)/market cap  => also calculated via (net cash/total shareholders)
4)now the actual price u will be paying for a company's share = SHARE_PRICE - CASH_PER_SHARE
In other words (CASH_PER_SHARE/SHARE_PRICE)*100 is the discount at which the share is avilable 

--does inventory growth rate is higher than sales growth rate ? 
very important for manufacturing and retail firms
if yes: inventory becomes obselete => write off or sell at discount => earnings take hit
also cash gets locked in inventory => depriving firm of cash 


--CCC = inventory days + recievable days - payable days
 It quantifies the number of days it takes a company to convert cash outflows into cash inflows  - In other words it is the time taken by the business to generate cash.
 It is a measure of  operating eficiency, lesser the CCC better is the firm's ability to compound shareholders wealth/generate return quickly
Inventory days measures how long a product is in storage before being sold.
if inventory days are more then the store/company has to go for a clearance sale with low pices , cash gets locked
if recievable days are more => customers are taking more days to pay for the goods then cash is locked in
if payable days are more CCC is -ve and also company gets to hold cash for a longer time reducing the need to take short term debt 
 hence improving operating cashflows
inventory turnover = COGS/inventory , companies with DCA have very high inventory turnover

Note: If two companies have similar values for return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA), it may be worth investing in the 
 company that has a lower CCC value. It indicates that the company is able to generate similar returns more quickly.


--"working capital intensive" operations? check WC/sales in screener - low is better
Working Capital = Current Assets â€“ Current Liabilities (day to day capital requirements)
E.g: aviation sector, real estate builders, gems & jewellery, engineering, power sector,steel production,automobile manufacturing,
 sugar sector and textile sector are highly capital intensive.
"working capital intensive" operations refers to businesses that require large amounts of working capital to produce 
sales(goods/services) and this is because of 3 reasons:
INVENTORY : store and maintain the inventory
e.g: sugar and textile sectors longer working capital cycles are due to their dependence on commodity-based inputs which are seasonal 
   in nature and necessitate their storage
CASH : company has large amount of fixed assets, such as property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) and hence to maintain that u need cash
       inflation of raw materials
RECIEVABLES : if companies realize proceeds from sales over a longer time-frame.
e.g: real estate and EPC sectors involve projects which take a long time to complete, resulting in long inventory holding periods
     export oriented companies might suffer due to long recievables
     power distribution companies have problems of collecting payment which leads to increase in Receivable days and often default

Note: for Higher working capital requirement companies as the cash gets locked in Inventory and recievables they need to take 
  higher debt to service working capital requirement. 
So, the return on equity (ROE) of these sectors is among the lowest
Also as take huge capital(or use more assets to produce sales), margins be low
As a rule of thumb u should avoid WC intense companies because they have high fixed costs/operating leverage, and hence high debt 
 if they can't have customer volumes, also they re-invest cashflow in fixed assets upgradation.
On the other hand, sectors such as FMCG, Mining, Oil & gas and IT produce higher returns by virtue of low or negative working capital cycles.
Companies with strong pricing/brand power has -ve working cycle meaning, they get money even before sales

Note: Combination of working capital heavy(need more capital/cash to generate sales) + more CCC days(need more time to generate
 cash from operations) => deadly combination and a sure shot wealth destructor


But they are very very few companies that are profitable in this segment by producing premium products/services and not 
 commodity products/services(if possible own them because the efficiency with which they operate acts as an entry barrier MOAT)


--check if Accounts Receivable is significant compared to sales over the years:
if yes there might be a default risk - also company might be in a highly competetive industry and to gain advantage, 
it might be giving more liberty to its customers
Also if the same thing is done by their peers then it will also have profit risk

--property, plant, equipment and machinery - cost should be either constant/decreasing/increaing at low rate? 
//gross block vs ney block 
Gross block is the sum total of all assets of the company valued at their cost of acquisition. This is inclusive of the 
depreciation that is to be charged on each asset. Net block is the gross block less accumulated depreciation on assets.
 Net block is actually what the asset are worth to the company.
if it is increaing consistently at a higher rate then the company is investing from it reserves or by taking debt to beat the competettion
this will eat up your profit as this extra money can be spent on some profitable ventures and hence you shouldn't invest
Note: increase in the value of net block(plant and capital) doesn't imply value appreciation, rather it means every year new fixed assets are being bought
check: The asset turnover ratio which measures the efficiency of a company's assets in generating revenue or sales.
also check capex spending (capex spending should be insync with net block)

--long term investments:
probe this section in annual reports notes to understand whether the management have invested in companies with DCA or medicore
businesses which are in a highly competetive industry
Note: increase in longterm investment doesn't mean the market value of investment has gone up rather it means every year company
is investing in some business

--Goodwill: if a company has a lot of goodwill compared to total assets(say > 10%) then check the impairment to goodwill and how acquired companies are performing
Economic Goodwill represents the increased/excess earnings arising from other intangible assets acquired in a business like brand 
 name,patents etc that are not individually identified and separately recognized. 
Accounting Goodwill is the premium paid over book value of a company.It is recognised as an asset needs to be written off over the 
period , i.e it is amorotised as an expense. But ironically the acquired company keeps growing bcoz of additional assets(tangible 
and intangible) acquired from child company.
Note: Economic Goodwill increases over time and Accounting Goodwill keeps decreasing, which means even though earnings are written 
off the company's earnings are increasing day by day => Focus on such companies because once the goodwill completely written off
 they will blast off as the company is actually making cash

 --amorotisation and depreciation
 amorotisation: intangible assets like goodwill are amorotised as an expense  
 depreciation: tangible asset loses value every year and eventually has to be replaced over time , hence the asset replacement cost is 
   depreciated and recorded as an expense
Note: we shouldn't remove depreciation expenses as they are real , but amorotisation expenses need to added back and counted as cashflow 



----------BALANCE SHEET (Liabilities)---------
if there is debt then usage of Debt is Very important 
  GOOD Usage: investment purposes/Acquisition purposes/Joint ventures/Reinvesting in your own business(capex augumentation/
  one time capex upgradation/new product launch/spending on technology for achieving efficiency)
  BAD Usage: expenses, continous capex upgradation

--short term debt:
if debt is more check cash in balance sheet and verify whether it is a long term debt or short term debt
avoid companies with short term debt > longterm debt
-if short term debt is high compared to longterm debt and no cash in balance sheet, the company has to sell its assets to 
cover the short term debt.

--long term debt:
usually DCA companies have zero or very low long term debt
if they have a longterm debt it should be payable using the net profits of next 3-4 yrs
Note: if the company has DCA and also a lot of debt then better to invest in bonds of that company and not stock, as the company
will be focused on paying interest and not on growing the company

--preferred stock ? 
preferred stock is not preferred to have in balance sheet - it is expensive money

--retained earnings: very very important
consistent growth and growth rate of retained earnings implies company has a DCA
Note: some DCA companies are so strong that they don't have to retain earnings, rathet they distribute it to shareholders
also check how is the company using retained earnings - infact it is very important than the former
it should invest in other DCA/profitable businesses, which inturn can increase their retained earnings and the process goes on

--any treasury stock ?
DCA compoanies usually have a lot of cash and they buyback shares
look for corporate actions in events section of tickertape by zerodha

--look reserves and net profit for every year - any abnormality(like reserves decreasing and profit increasing)observed ?
also look at the notes for reserves


---------------- INCOME STATEMENT ----------------
if subsidaries listed check standalone statements else check consolidated statements
e.g: HDFC - subsidaries are HDFC bank, HDFC amc, HDFC life and all these 3 are listed
consolidated financial statements - reports all activities of a company, its subsidiaries as a combined entity
e.g L&T - certain subsidaries are not listed and hence u need to look at consolidated statement as the subsidary earnings are included in the consolidated statement

--sales increasing?
if NO why?

--GPM higher(>40%) and consistent or growing over last 10yrs? :
if yes => company has pricing power bcoz of some kind of MOAT/competitive advantage over its peers
if GPM<20 then the company is in a fierecely competetive industry where no company has DCA

--operating expenses (factors that can strip off competettive advantage from the company and eat away profits)
1)R&D spending(check in operating expenses)
does the compnay consistently needs to spend on R&D for survival?
if yes : R&D cost should be negligible or < 5% of gross profit
2)sales and admin expenses(check in operating expenses)
should be consistently < 50%-60% of gross profit depending on the peers - indicating brand/MOAT power
if it increases heavily every year then company is trying to fight its competetion by spending on marketing, advertising and paying more to employees
if the company incuding its peers consistently have >=100% of gross profit then the industry is highly competetive
if the company is consistently spending on marketing then check whether the next year sales is increasing or not
3)interest costs(can be found in p&l or financing cashflows)
interest should be <10-15% of operating income/profit. (but it depends on industry and its peers)
company with high debt means either it in highly competetive industry and it needs debt to finance the capex for survival
OR it has acquired other company by taking debt
NOTE: Generally in a given industry company with lowest ratio of interest to operating income has a competetive advantage

--OPM higer it is the better
It tells you how good is the management in cutting down the operating costs.
But you want the company to be cost effective and profitable, hence OPM has to be accompained by NPM

-- strength check: What are the earnings/situation of the company in 2008 and 2020 crisis?
however it completely depends on the industry. it is possible that all companies in the sector have done poorly

-- amort/dep as a % of fixed assets: 
Note: in general it should be > 10% not less. if it is less then company is inflating the earnings by pushing expenses to future
-- amort/dep as a % of gross profit/operating: 
companies with DCA has <10% and also much lesser compared to peers otherwise net profit and EPS takes a hit

--other income: significant compared to operating income? like >20-25%
also compare other income contribution to net profit
if yes: since it is non operating and  non recurring income, it should be removed from calculation
check notes section if the amount is significant or continously increasing over the years
if no: we can ignore

--interest income: 
if < 10% of operating profit and long term debt can be serviced by next 4 yr earnings then having debt is fine

--tax:
is it consistently paying fixed % of taxes or any tax relaxation from govt 
if there is a tax relaxation from govt then company might be catching on the subsidy keeping sales down

--net income:
can be manipulated due to one time huge other income(keep an eye) and not all the net income is cash so check cashflow statement
operating cashflow must be consistently greater than net income or if not equal

-- durability check: does net profit have a upward trend?
if yes, are you sure it will continue
if no, are you sure of the trend reversal - very rare case trend reversal happens

--NPM consistent/increasing ?
if net income is increasing your sales growth should also be increasing otherwise if a 
company with DCA generally has NPM > 15-20% 
if NPM < 10% then company belongs is a highly competetive industry where no one has a durable competettive advantage (DCA)


--EPS
does eps have a upward trend or it has lot of fluctuations?
stay away from cyclical stocks for long term
Note: EPS can be manipulated in multiple ways like stock buybacks, convertible bonds, equity capital
so EPS increase should be along with sales, net income and cashflow increase 


---------------- CASH FLOW: more important than income statement ----------------------
Cat1: businesses that grow but needs a lot of capital like adani group
cat2: businesses that grow but DOESN'T need a lot of capital like britannia

--operating cashflow
if net profit is increasing and operating cashflow is decreasing - company is in a highly competetive industry and 
selling products on credit
if operating cashflow is -ve then either reserves used or debt is raised -  be careful here
--working capital changes : discrepancy b/w net profit and operating cash flow is mostly bcoz of WCC
working capital changes = current liabilities - current assets
+ve meaning: consistently +ve means company has some moat and hence suppliers are giving them supplies on credit, but if it is significant
 compared to OCF then that's a problem because someday cash is gonna go to suppliers and hence retained earnings will take a hit
Also company is said to be consuming more cash than it is generating
-ve meaning: consistently -ve  means company might be in a competetive industry or it might be a small company that
neither have power nor a choice but to wait.


--cash flow from investing:
--Capex: 
Capex(check in Cash flow from investing) <25-30% of net profit?
capex is good as it useful to capture market share. but capex increase using high amounts of debt is risky
bcoz debt increases => interest expense increases => net earnings decrease => EPS decreases => share price decreases
make sure to check the capex source over the years: debt/reserves/operating cash flow
some DCA companies use debt for capex and at the same time does buyback of shares to reduce the impact on EPS and share price
Also if the company consistently need to do capex to stay in the business - earnings will be affected Avoid such businesses
for contionous capex businesses check sales growth is it increasing? 
if yes then capacity is being expanded
if no equipment is being replaced - must avoid businesses
Special case: 
--investment sold and purchased : check financial notes (especially subsidary investments)
--check historical buyback in cash flow from investing (issuance/retirement of stock) 
if yes company has DCA and is generating lot of cash to buyback


--cash flow from financing
check if the company took new capital (i.e new debt or new equity) in the current year
Also check if the company CONSISTENTLY raising capital via the debt and equity
if new debt => interest expense => net profit and EPS decreases => share price decrease
if new equity => outstanding shares increases => EPS decreases => share price decrease
also if operating cashflow < debt + equity then company is consuming more cash compared to the generated cash

--Net cash flow < 0 ?
if yes then look at reserves(usually decreases) and debt(usually increases) to meet the obilgations
sometimes negative net cash flow is becoz of investing activities and positive cash flow is bcoz of debt - check that

--free cash flow:
every year free cash_flows are added to reserves
Company is called extraorinary  if free cash flow > 70% of net profit (u can check freecashflow on tijori/morningstar)
free cash flow -ve bcoz of operating cash flow => company is bad and in-efficienct
free cash flow -ve bcoz of capex => company might be trying to build a moat OR company with moat trying to capture market share ,
to verify that :look net income, return ratios etc
-free cash flow as % of net profit?
-free cash flow as % of sales?
check cash_flow.txt


----------------- OPERATIONAL RATIOS ---------------------
quick ratio: >1 and <2.5
-important for manufacturing firms as lot of cash tends to be locked in the form of inventory
qucik assets = current assets - inventory (inventory is removed bcoz it cannot be converted to cash immediately)
current ratio >1 and <3 is preferred:
current ratio > 3 is more dangerous than <1 
if a company has current ratio > 3 means management is not using cash efficiently or inventory is too high or recievables are increasing(all are bad)
but the importance of this ratio is high in deciding liquidity for avg companies but not so important for DCA companies, as 
 DCA companies often have current ratio < 1 and their earning power is so high that it doesn't matter
Debt/Equity(keep in mind the industry - bank, energy, machinery ect have high debt): 
if D/E > 0 - check the debt position of peers and ICR of the company and interest expense as a % of operating profit
Also some times D/E can be misleading as many DCA companies don't need to have retained earnings/equity in their balance sheet
rather they use it to buyback shares which goes into treasury stock section or give as dividends.
Hence it is recommended to check the debt along with D/E


----------------- PROFITIABILITY RATIOS ---------------------
GPM: constant/increaing(profit increasing?)/decreasing(sales increasing?)
OPM: constant/increaing(profit increasing?)/decreasing(sales increasing?)
avg 5yrs ROE: 
-ROE determines how efficient is the management in using shareholders money
EQUITY=common and preffered stock + Retained Earnings
-some DCA companies have strong net earnings but -ve ROE don't need to have retained earnings. 
But insolvent companies only have -ve ROE so be careful
Note: if both ROE and Reserves/free cash flow are increasing then management is using Reserves efficiently
if freecash flow is -ve due to heavy expansion and ROE is increasing in the coming years then company is profiting from capacity expansion
Traps: buyback can inflate ROE, companies recently separated from parent companies can have huge ROE
avg 5yrs ROCE:
-ROE might not be a appropriate measure for companies with varied capital structure bcoz companies can boost ROE by taking high debt
 hence ROCE comes in the picture
EPS CAGR:
EPS trend : upward/downward/constant
highest EPS in past 10yrs?

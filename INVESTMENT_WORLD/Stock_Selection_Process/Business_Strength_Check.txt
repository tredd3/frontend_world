//overall requirements to be satisfied by a company
BUSINESS + FINANCIAL +  Management + VALUATION (all are equally important) + Margin of safety(for growth companies,
fair price for Value companies)
decision ONLY  based on facts(news, reports) and reasoning(think, compare), not on opinion and emotions
Provide Continuous fuel and efficiency to the process: keep updated with present knowledge
//why valuation are important?
if you buy an extraordinary company that is over valued, then it might take a decade for the earnings to catchup to the price
till then the stock price is not moving anywhere.
Which means the company will still make money , earnings will grow but your money won't grow, instead u could have kept the money in 
index funds/liquid debt funds


----------------------- PAST: company Background and Past performance ---------------------
---why did the promoters start business (family legacy/passion/strategic importance to other companies) - PASSION clearly wins

---Resources to know about the  company/business : 
1)wikipedia
2)company website - most important for updated info 
3)screener summary
5)tijori overview page
5)crisil report and ratings scroll to the end of the page(about company, subsidaries, rating history)
CRISIL Ratings:
A AA AAA (Adequate to highest safety)
B BB BBB (Moderate to high risk)
C (Very high risk)
D (Default)
6)company filings(investor presentation, conference calls and annual report(investments, debt sections)) from tijori

https://www.moneycontrol.com/equity-research/stock-recommendations-active

---what peter lynch bucket does stock belongs to?  check share price trend over the years you will get to know
1)slow growers(low risk, low returns)  - the only reason to hold should be dividends
2)stalwarts(low risk, moderate returns) - check if they can maintain the momentum and are getting in to diworsefications?
  companies acquiring market share from organised peers or unorganised peers
3)fast growers(high risk, high returns) :
  can they replicate the growth story somewhere else? e.g cam Matrimony replicate the startegy even in bangladesh(we need to monitor)
  what room is still left for growth?
  emerging tech companies
  companies in emerging industries
4)turnarounds(high risk, high returns)  - value unlocking via selling off the divisons that are less profitable/sell divisons in highly
  competettive industry OR increase the efficiency of the process/divisons by cost cutting and technology upgradation etc, which will
  translate them to low cost producer.
  value unlocking(highly profitable companies getting demerged from conglomerates e.g: ITC Infotech, ITC FMCG demerger from ITC group
  sleeping gaints awakened  - what road map does the company have from loss to profits (VI, IDFC FIRST BANK, TATA CONSUMER)
  ignored companies that have very strong growth potential in the future
Note: don't buy a turnaround just because stock price is down, own it if business is starting to pickup, financials are great etc
5)cyclicals(high risk, low returns or low risk high returns depending upon the cycle at which u have invested) - the more things 
  are stressed the better will be the recovery
  //Always prefer non cyclical or least cyclical
  cyclical + high fixed cost => DANGER as debt levels will be high, e.g: Airlines
  Note: Timing is everything in cyclicals
6)asset plays(low risk, high returns) - price vs value play (balance sheet scanning is must)
   hidden assets(like extrememly profitable subsidaries or divisons) like ITC
   natural resources like land, real estate,gold, oil or cash etc in high amounts? where the value of these exceeds the stock price
   patience is the key here because it might take years for wall street to discover these gems and re-rate the stock

Note: 
--companies keep shifting the buckets like fast growers can become slow growers or slow growers can become cyclicals
--cyclicals can become turarounds
--stalwarts like MCD can become asset plays bcoz of the real estate it owns
--growth expectation should not be the same for all the categories stocks alike


--------------------------------------- PRESENT ----------------------------------------
---Sectoral analysis:
Information Source: 
check sector_summary folder (from morning star analysts)
https://www.tijorifinance.com/company/marico-limited/#knowledgebase
https://www.ibef.org/industry.aspx
you will get information about a sector in the Annual Report/IPO DRHP
STAGE :pioneering/growth/maturity/obselete
//Sector value chain : from sourcing to sales entire process and businesses involved must be known (you should always pick companies 
at profitable end of value chain) demand and supply (size of opportunity)



---Products/services DEMAND check :
//From where does the demand come?
  B2B supplier (client diversification, strong order book)
  B2C (are the products frequently used by each and every individual, creating high demand)?  
    Reason: strong demand => supply increases => revenue increases => EPS increases => share price increase => your money grows)
  Business service companies (almost every business should find its usage now or eventually)
//Type of demand
    Infrastructure/Platform - repeat usage including subscripton models
    continous and growing demand - volume led growth reaching to larger audience(personal care, healthcare, insurnace, 
      real estate, home furnishing, Energy,Banking and finance)
    continous and replacement/upgradation demand based on latest trends/depreciation - value addition (clothing and footwear, 
    Electronics, Automobile, Telecommunication)
    continous and constant/slow growth demand(FMCG, Food)
    one time demand(capital goods) then growth oppurtunities size should be vast like Praj.Even though Praj establishes the ethanol
     plant, it has huge oppurtunity abroad/huge order backlog both domestic and abroad
    Transition Demand - EV, Renewable Energy, 5G, New Technology - need a lot of research as it can make or break your portfolio
//Market size/Oppurtunity:
   limited to few businesses
   limited customer usage 
   within the country
   global oppurtunity/exports


---Products/services SUPPLY check :
product diversification - what all products company manufactures (you can find in investor presentation)
prefer high margin non commoditized business - if commoditized then must be a low cost producer
check market share trend over the years in tijori - to know how much demand is being catered by the company 
  Also to know if the company is losing the business to competetiors
Is there any peer whose market share is higher than the current company? - great way to find a excellent competetior business
can company's business/products/services be replaced/substituted by new age technology/innovative products/services?
Competettion: 
  what is the unlisted players market share?
  listed peers - tijori(benchmark) and screener peer comparison sections for profitability and costs
  global competettion - imports risk from china or any other low cost producer country?
  threat of new entrants
how do peers provide competetion : strong moats/geographical expansion/innovative products/capex spending
POSITION IN PEERS :

--- Products/services quality and value addition to customers check :
//does it delight the customers or own consumer minds (i.e people always remember this company when u talk about this product)? 
//what value does it add to customers?
//how is the quality of product/service - Have u used the product/service ? 
  if YES, what is your view 
  if NO, go and open their website, check public review in ecommerce or google search
Note: if you are investing in this company only because of a specific product like chawyan prash(dabur), Royal enfield(Eicher) etc
always check wt % revenues are contributed by that product (for Eicher RE contributes around 90% revenues so it can be a buy based
 on further analysis but Dabur cannot be a buy based on chawayan prash because it contibutes < 10% to revenue)


--------------------------------------- FUTURE ----------------------------------------
---Process/Strategy check?
//do you know market leader success and failures stories? if yes apply then to the current company process/strategy
//how is the Management and their Vision:
Ideally we should onvest in a business which even a fool can run because someday or the other 
a fool does - Warren Buffet
check Management_Check.txt


--- Sustainabile Growth of Earnings check :
//competettive advantage/MOAT Check?
  Does MOAT Exists? check MOATS.txt
  if yes is the MOAT durable, i.e can the company keep its DCA nature for next 10 yrs OR will competetiors snatch away 
   the profits? Imagine and think with a calm mind take in to account, facts and reasoning not opinion
  if NO MOAT what is the 10 yr picture u have in ur mind? will it build one?
  what is the uniqueness in product/service
  monopoly or duopoly


//pricing power - are people ready to pay premium (can the compnay increase the product/services prices in the cases like inflation 
and supply chain disruption or in general and be sure that people still buy their products and they don't loose their business to 
competettion) proof: sales trend is upwards and Net profit Margin trend is either stable or upwards(tijori)
 This will happen only when they add value to the customers in terms of 
   i)quality of product/service OR
   ii)affordable price OR any other thing which their competetiors cannot give
//bargaining power of suppliers - if suppliers have the power it is pretty bad
//bargaining power of consumers - like e-commerce , this means company is in a highly competettive business


//Growth potential/Oppurtunities ?
Geographical diversification - globally present? if not does it have a deep rural reach?
 better to have both, which helps in risk Management and strong growth oppurtunities in emerging countries
 for a company with high global presence , global competettion, political and currency risk need to be monitored
---Source of capital : retained earnings(cheapest and most preferred)/debt(next preference)/new equity(EPS will decrease)
---source of earnings: earnings source is more than earnings itself bcoz earnings source decides whether the earning growth is 
      sustainable or not
- Acquire new customers - sell more products in older markets(deeper penetration to areas like rural/untapped areas, takeaway market 
    share from competetiors in those areas)
- Launch New products - capex and manufacture new products(innovated products/refurbised products) and selling them to old customers at high prices
- Global expansion/ exports - Launch products in new markets
- Increase the price of old product, but increase in volume -  if volumes don't increase after some years your company earnings
  growth rate = inflation(6%) and in the long run as the stock price depends ONLY on earnings, it will also grow at 6%, meaning ur 
  money also grows at 6% and the purpose of investing in stock markets to beat infalation is gone. Also if sales are not increasing 
  then demand has dried up OR competetiors taking away market share - Both are bad situations
- cost cutting(cannot cut cost beyond a certain point)
- dispose losing operations (increases firm efficiency)
- Acquistion and synergy led growth(Acquistion for strategic purpose(augumenting existing business) or pure investment related purposes
  then its fine else acquiring companies to become a conglomerate is bad)
- it is in a growing sector with tailwinds
- it is in a non growth/dull sector but company keeps growing by capturing market share from other organised/unorganised players
- Accounting tricks/fraud(increased other income, lower amort and dep charges)

Note: Both Growth MOATS and Growth oppurtunities need to exist else earnings are not sustainable
Company with No Moats  but very high growth oppurtunities - a short term buy becuase other competetiors with MOATS can take away the
market share soon - need to monitor closely
company with good MOATS but not very good growth oppurtunities - it has become a slow grower(if you have lot of money u can invest
 here if not search for stalwarts or fast growers)

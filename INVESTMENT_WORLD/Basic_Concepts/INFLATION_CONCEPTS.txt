**** SUMMARY ****
inflation is temporary
inflation and interest rates are directly proportional, i.e if inflation rises interest rates will also rise
inflation => less real returns on fixed deposits, bonds etc

//Reasons of inflation


//Effect of High Inflation on economy:
price of goods/services increases
currency will lose value
RBI reacts with high interest rates
public/corporate spending decreases bcoz of costlier loans - hence when demand decreases , 
  supply decreases meaning corporate profits take a hit


//Effects of Inflation on Asset classes
Equities: there will be a sell off across equities and people wants to invest in bonds/debt instruments as interest rate increases , 
  the reason for sell off is that as interest rate increses demand decreases , hence corporate earnings decrease and stocks become 
  overvalued
 Note: this is the oppurtunity to grab the best stocks and invest in them 
Real estate  and land - price and rents increase , consider investing in REITs => as they invest in commercial properties
Gold will rise - hedge against inflation, but when inflation decreases gold prices decrease and equities will rally
 Note: If you want to invest in Gold invest when inflation is low and is about to raise else you will lose money
CASH: purchasing power decreases as value decreases
CRYPTO : price increases


*** Types of inflation ******
1)demand pull: supply/production capacity remains the same, demand is high due to low interest rates
e.g: property prices increase becuase every one has wealth and wants to buy the property
2)cost push : demand and supply remains the same, but production cost increases
e.g: raw material cost/fuel cost increases, final product cost increases => companies can take a hit on balance sheet or they
can pass the price to customer
3)supply decreases : this is due to issues like geo-political issues/ supply chain disruptions  etc but demand remains constant


**** interest rates and inflation goes hand in hand *****
inflation is up => RBI generally increases interest rates (BULL MARKET) => stock market earnings goes down or there is a high 
expectations and if that is not met => people remove money from stocks and invest in risk free returns (Bonds/FDs) => stock
 market can crash as well
*e.g: US increase interest rates => FIIs will remove money from indian markets and invest in US bonds => stock market will crash
inflation is down => RBI decreases interest rates => (BULL MARKET) people invest in stock market and create bubble and markets PE becomes high

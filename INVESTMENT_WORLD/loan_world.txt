//Longer loan tenure advantages:

1)Control in our hand - EMI can be increased if needed but very difficult to increase
Also pre-payment can be done when needed - so u will be paying less interest to banks
2)Monthly expenses and investments will not take a hit since the EMI is less 
3)Money loses value over time - so in the long run u will technically be paying lesser amount
i.e todayâ€™s 20,000 is much worth than 20,000 after 5 yrs
4)Moreover salary increases every year hence EMI/salary ratio keeps on decreasing
Remaining amount can be invested
5)U can take new loans if needed for other reasons/investments
6)If it is a home loan - then tax advantage



//Loan pre-payment vs investment 

Which one is better - depends on the tenure of the loan and pre-payment time
EMI : in the initials years  major part(say 80%) is used for interest payment and remaining in principal payment
let us say tenor is 20 yrs
In the first 10 years : major part of the EMI goes towards interest payment
In next 10yrs: major part of the EMI goes towards interest payment
so Pre-payment should be done in the first 10yrs (i.e < half of the tenure) so that u pay less interest to bank
Else no point in pre-payment as after 10yrs u r anyways paying principal. Rather u should invest the surplus amount in equity.

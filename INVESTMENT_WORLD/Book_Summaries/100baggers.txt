compounding effect is the key

//Time taken by companies to become 100X (Avg 26 yrs)
60 companies took 1-15yrs (lucky)
180 companies took 16-30 years 
100 companies took 31-45 years 


//Characteristics of 100 baggers:
1) small companies 
2) twin engines of growth - earnings and multiple expansion
3) Avoid companies that only pay dividends and no reinvestment (BSE,CDSL,CAMS,IEX etc)
high ROCE + generating cash + high reinvestment oppurtunities for a long period of time 
 Note: MOATS is the most important thing to have
high ROCE + generating cash + NO reinvestment oppurtunities - didn't become multibaggers
4)managers are owners themselves (IDFC first)
founders are owners (berkshire, microsoft)
5)best businesses always hit all time high over and over again
6)patience is the key - holding makes you rich
7)99% of the time, best ideas are the simplest ones

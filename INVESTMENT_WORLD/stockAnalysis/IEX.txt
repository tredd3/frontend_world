IEX: power exchange (buy/sell physical delivery)
//summary section
**MOAT/competettive advantage
companies save lot of money buying electricity on exchange, instead of direct buying from producer
**RISK
highly regulated by central electricity regulatory commission (CERC), which decides pricing power
CERC is planning to launch market coupling.

** Red flags - those that stop you from investment/ think you twice before investing
market coupling - IEX might lose monopoly - buyers on other exchanges can buy from sellers on IEX and buyers on IEX can buy sellers 
of other exchanges
**Green flags
monopoly - 95% market share

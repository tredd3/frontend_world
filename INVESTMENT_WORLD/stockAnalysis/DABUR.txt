//why Dabur?

mixed product portfolio
global presence (Local Supply Chain in overseas markets)
focusing mainly in south india - where most of the people are rich and health concious
having hindi product names - helps in increasing product reach in rural areas(given the fact that most of 
india's population is rural this is extremely positive )
management focus on statying in the business rather than financials by increasing prices
structural changes like giving autonomy to e-commerce team, consisting of young people so that they can take qucik calls
and acquiring lateral talent to build capabilities in the Company to build the organization for the future
Technology transformation:  like IT, sales and marketing automation, manufacturing automation , R&D etc will be driven by new 
 recruits in the senior management team , these are from very reputed organizations.
Also Dabur makes sure that Ayurvedic Products are still relevant to current generation by doing lot of innovation and building
 products as per their taste, needs and current trend
By increasing the localization of manufacturing and supply chain, and focusing on digitization and process automation the 
 business is reducing costs and increasing its efficiency and flexibility to access the local markets.

//Next Annual report 
Dabur has launched new prodcuts successfully over the years -  did this continue (see all the newly launched products growth)
additional market share captured (look at sales increase and volume growth as well)
Note: sales = volume * price
 Home Care, Food & Beverages declined in the previous year (should increase this year if not look at FY 20 AR for numbers)
-ve: look at advertisement spend and also current FY sales > previous FY sales + Advertisement (if no then look at he trend to know
 whether it has happened for this year or it has been repeating over the years)

Summary:
//growth strategy: innovation + acquistion + operating cost reduction + sell products overseas

//Strengths:
Strong position in India’s FMCG industry
Healthy financial risk profile - Rs 5,000 crore of cash and equivalent and marketable securities 

//Weakness:
The company faces competition from players in organised and unorganised sectors. Because of the growing popularity of herbal and 
 natural products, other established FMCG players are launching similar products, putting pressure on the company’s market position
 and operating efficiency.
lot of reserves went in to investment in debt instruments of 10+ yrs rather they would have been used for acquistions/ capex,
 however ROE is above 30% which is good

//-ve factors to be monitored :
Erosion in market share in key business segments, leading to lower cash accrual => people definitely prefer ayurveda products to
 chemical products but are they sticking to Dabur can only be known by market share
Large, debt-funded capex or acquisition weakening the financial risk profile
Things mentioned in next anual report section needs to be monitored

//Risks:
keep an eye on market share growth
inflation of raw materials - dabur tackled it by slowly passing it down to customers but not completely as they may lose cutomers
margins depend on middle class purchasing power - launched low cost products and increased reach in rural areas
new companies with ayurvedic products
highly competettive industry - hence high operating expenses and low margins
ayurveda products attract customers, but if it comes from a reputed brand then it attracts more => check whether any reputed 
 companies are coming up with ayurvedic protolio


//fair valuation - 540 based on DCF

**STRENGTH
MOAT/competitive advantage?
 1)check summaries/MOATS.txt (how company insulates itself from competetion)
 2)unique product/service : 
 3)low cost buyer and seller :
 i.e does the company make margins from volumes by spreading the operating expenses mainly R&D? 
 Note: but be careful as the volumes go down profits go down as well.Also these kind of companies must play with volumes
 Does the company have economies of scale? bcoz low lost seller needs to have this else the profits will take a hit
 economic of scale is the ability of the firm to leverage its fixed cost infrastructure across various clients(remember fixed costs 
 should be in limit and not so much like airlines that the company might go bankruptcy during economic downturn)
 operating leverage of the firm increases because of this ability.(check in profit loss statement - tijori finace)
 operating leverage is 3 => if revenues grow by x then operating income grows  by 3x (not net income)
 Note: if operating leverage is very high because of fixed costs company can be wildly profitable and can also be bankrupt
 so companies with high operating leverages must focus on revenue increase and capturing market share
 4)users consistently need the product/service?
 -will the products be used by most no of people, if not now in the future?
 5)does this compnay or its products own the consumers mind?
 6)is the public ready to pay premium for these brand products?
 B2B MOATS:
 is the switching cost > benifits of new products?
  -products tightly integrated into customers business?
  -is there any long term contract?
  -does the customers staff needs training for new products usage?
 why is the customer not willing to switch?

is it durable ?
 past - look for consistency in numbers in  financial statements
 future - wide/narrow/no economic moat?
 can the company keep its DCA nature for next 20 yrs?
 can the competetiors snatch away the profits? 
 
why earning power is important?
 even though the company has DCA over its peers, if the company doesn't have earning power bcoz of the less
  market size/weak industry future/govt rules etc, then it doesn't make sense to buy 

does the company have long term earning power? (check FUTURE section)
-will the company exist after 10yrs
-if yes can you predict how does the company business look like after 10-15yrs?
-will they still be in the race or is there any replacement/innovation?

globally competitive?
circle of competence? check sector summary
vertical/horizontal growth oppurtunities?
CRISIL Rating and report in screener?

**** Company ****
**PAST: financials
https://www.screener.in/company/ZYDUSWELL/consolidated/
https://www.tijorifinance.com/company/zydus-wellness/
other income % contribution to net profit
did it beat NIFTY in past 10yrs? 
continous dividend payment history: yes/no


*BALANCE SHEET:
**assets
--current assets > current liabilities ?
Note: some DCA companies might not have CA>CL but their earning power and DCA helps them sail through
--cash increasing? 
is the cash generated bcoz of operations? 
Note: check last 10yrs balance sheet to find out
--check cash/market_cap : if > 50% buy

--does inventory growth rate is higher than sales growth rate ? 
if yes: inventory becomes obselete => write off or sell at discount => earnings take hit
also cash gets locked in inventory => depriving firm of cash 
cash conversion cycle -ve ?
CCC = inventory days + recievable days - payable days 
if inventory days are more then the store/company has to go for a clearance sale with low pices , cash gets locked
if payable days are more CCC is -ve and also company gets to hold cash for a longer time reducing the need to take short term debt hence improving operating cashflows
if recievable days are more => customers are taking more days to pay for the goods then cash is locked in
inventory turnover = COGS/inventory , companies with DCA have very high inventory turnover

--check if Accounts Receivable is significant compared to sales over the years:
if yes there might be a default risk - also company might be in a highly competetive industry and to gain advantage, 
it might be giving more liberty to its customers
Also if the same thing is done by their peers then it will also have profit risk

--plant and equipment cost should be either constant/decreasing/increaing at low rate? 
if it is increaing consistently at a higher rate then the company is investing from it reserves or by taking debt to beat the competettion
this will eat up your profit as this extra money can be spent on some profitable ventures and hence you shouldn't invest
Note: increase in the value of net block(plant and capital) doesn't imply value appreciation, rather it means every year new fixed assets are being bought

--long term investments:
probe this section in annual reports notes to understand whether the management have invested in companies with DCA or medicore
businesses which are in a highly competetive industry
Note: increase in longterm investment doesn't mean the market value of investment has gone up rather it means every year company
is investing in some business

--Goodwill: if a company has a lot of good will then go and probe what all the companies it acquired and if they are worth the value


**liabilities
--short term debt:
if debt is more check cash in balance sheet and verify whether it is a long term debt or short term debt
avoid companies with short term debt > longterm debt
-if short term debt is high compared to longterm debt and no cash in balance sheet, the company has to sell its assets to 
cover the short term debt.

--long term debt:
usually DCA companies have zero or very low long term debt
if they have a longterm debt it should be payable using the net profits of next 3-4 yrs
Note: if the company has DCA and also a lot of debt then better to invest in bonds of that company and not stock, as the company
will be focused on paying interest and not on growing the company

--preferred stock ? 
preferred stock is not preferred to have in balance sheet - it is expensive money

--retained earnings: very very important
consistent growth and growth rate of retained earnings implies company has a DCA
Note: some DCA companies are so strong that they don't have to retain earnings, rathet they distribute it to shareholders
also check how is the company using retained earnings - infact it is very important than the former
it should invest in other DCA/profitable businesses, which inturn can increase their retained earnings and the process goes on

--any treasury stock ?
DCA compoanies usually have a lot of cash and they buyback shares

--look reserves and net profit for every year - any abnormality(like reserves decreasing and profit increasing)observed ?
also look at the notes for reserves


*INCOME STATEMENT:
if subsidaries listed check standalone statements
else check consolidated 

--sales increasing?
if NO why?

--GPM higher(>40%) and consistent or growing over last 10yrs? :
if yes => company has pricing power bcoz of some kind of MOAT/competitive advantage over its peers
if GPM<20 then the company is in a fierecely competetive industry where no company has DCA

--operating expenses (factors that can strip off competettive advantage from the company and eat away profits)
1)R&D spending(check in operating expenses)
does the compnay consistently needs to spend on R&D for survival?
if yes : R&D cost should be negligible or < 5% of gross profit
2)sales and admin expenses(check in operating expenses)
should be consistently < 50%-60% of gross profit depending on the peers - indicating brand/MOAT power
if it increases heavily every year then company is trying to fight its competetion by spending on marketing, advertising and paying more to employees
if the company incuding its peers consistently have >=100% of gross profit then the industry is highly competetive
if the company is consistently spending on marketing then check whether the next year sales is increasing or not
3)interest costs(can be found in p&l or financing cashflows)
interest should be <10-15% of operating income/profit. (but it depends on industry and its peers)
company with high debt means either it in highly competetive industry and it needs debt to finance the capex for survival
OR it has acquired other company by taking debt
NOTE: Generally in a given industry company with lowest ratio of interest to operating income has a competetive advantage


-- strength check: What are the earnings/situation of the company in 2008 and 2020 crisis?
however it completely depends on the industry. it is possible that all companies in the sector have done poorly

-- amort/dep as a % of fixed assets: 
Note: in general it should be 15-20% not less. if it is less then company is inflating the earnings by pushing expenses to future
-- amort/dep as a % of gross profit/operating: 
companies with DCA has <10% and also much lesser compared to peers

--other income: significant compared to operating income? like >15-20%
if yes: since it is non operating and  non recurring income, it should be removed from calculation
check notes section if the amount is significant or continously increasing over the years
if no: we can ignore

--interest income: 
if < 10% of operating profit and long term debt can be serviced by next 4 yr earnings then having debt is fine

--tax:
is it consistently paying fixed % of taxes or any tax relaxation from govt 
if there is a tax relaxation from govt then company might be catching on the subsidy keeping sales down

--net income:
can be manipulated due to one time huge other income(keep an eye) and not all the net income is cash so check cashflow statement
operating cashflow must be consistently greater than net income or if not equal

-- durability check: does net profit have a upward trend?
if yes, are you sure it will continue
if no, are you sure of the trend reversal - very rare case trend reversal happens

--NPM consistent/increasing ?
if net income is increasing your sales growth should also be increasing otherwise if a 
company with DCA generally has NPM > 15-20% 
if NPM < 10% then company belongs is a highly competetive industry where no one has a durable competettive advantage (DCA)


--EPS
does eps have a upward trend or it has lot of fluctuations?
stay away from cyclical stocks for long term
Note: EPS can be manipulated in multiple ways like stock buybacks, convertible bonds, equity capital
so EPS increase should be along with sales, net income and cashflow increase 


*CASH FLOW: more important than income statement
Cat1: businesses that grow but needs a lot of capital like adani group
cat2: businesses that grow but DOESN'T need a lot of capital like britannia

--operating cashflow
if net profit is increasing and operating cashflow is decreasing - company is in a highly competetive industry and 
selling products on credit
if operating cashflow is -ve then either reserves used or debt is raised -  be careful here
--working capital changes : discrepancy b/w net profit and operating cash flow is mostly bcoz of WCC
working capital changes = current liabilities - current assets
+ve meaning: consistently +ve means company has some moat and hence suppliers are giving them supplies on credit, but if it is significant
 compared to OCF then that's a problem because someday cash is gonna go to suppliers and hence retained earnings will take a hit
Also company is said to be consuming more cash than it is generating
-ve meaning: consistently -ve  means company might be in a competetive industry or it might be a small company that
neither have power nor a choice but to wait.


--cash flow from investing:
--Capex: 
Capex(check in Cash flow from investing) <25-50% of net profit?
capex is good as it useful to capture market share. but capex increase using high amounts of debt is risky
bcoz debt increases => interest expense increases => net earnings decrease => EPS decreases => share price decreases
make sure to check the capex source over the years: debt/reserves/operating cash flow
some DCA companies use debt for capex and at the same time does buyback of shares to reduce the impact on EPS and share price
Also if the company consistently need to do capex to stay in the business - earnings will be affected Avoid such businesses
Special case: 
--investment sold and purchased : check financial notes (especially subsidary investments)
--check historical buyback in cash flow from investing (issuance/retirement of stock) 
if yes company has DCA and is generating lot of cash to buyback


--cash flow from financing
check if the company took new debt or new equity in the current year
Also check if the company CONSISTENTLY raising capital via the debt and equity
if new debt => interest expense => net profit and EPS decreases => share price decrease
if new equity => outstanding shares increases => EPS decreases => share price decrease
also if operating cashflow < debt + equity then company is consuming more cash compared to the generated cash

--Net cash flow < 0 ?
if yes then look at reserves(usually decreases) and debt(usually increases) to meet the obilgations
sometimes negative net cash flow is becoz of investing activities and positive cash flow is bcoz of debt - check that

--free cash flow:
every year free cash_flows are added to reserves
Company is called extraorinary  if free cash flow > 70% of net profit (u can check freecashflow on tijori/morningstar)
free cash flow -ve bcoz of operating cash flow => company is bad and in-efficienct
free cash flow -ve bcoz of capex => company might be trying to build a moat OR company with moat trying to capture market share ,
to verify that :look net income, return ratios etc
-free cash flow as % of net profit?
-free cash flow as % of sales?
check cash_flow.txt


*OPERATIONAL RATIOS:
quick ratio: >1 and <2.5
-important for manufacturing firms as lot of cash tends to be locked in the form of inventory
current assets - inventory (inventory is removed bcoz it cannot be converted to cash immediately)
current ratio >1 and <3 is preferred:
current ratio > 3 is more dangerous than <1 
if a company has current ratio > 3 means management is not using cash efficiently or inventory is too high or recievables are increasing(all are bad)
but the importance of this ratio is high in deciding liquidity for avg companies but not so important for DCA companies, as 
 DCA companies often have current ratio < 1 and their earning power is so high that it doesn't matter
Debt/Equity(keep in mind the industry - bank, energy, machinery ect have high debt): 
if D/E > 0 - check the debt position of peers and ICR of the company and interest expense as a % of operating profit
Also some times D/E can be misleading as many DCA companies don't need to have retained earnings/equity in their balance sheet
rather they use it to buyback shares which goes into treasury stock section or give as dividends.
Hence it is recommended to check the debt along with D/E


*PROFITIABILITY RATIOS:
GPM: constant/increaing(profit increasing?)/decreasing(sales increasing?)
OPM: constant/increaing(profit increasing?)/decreasing(sales increasing?)
avg 5yrs ROE: 
-ROE determines how efficient is the management in using shareholders money
EQUITY=common and preffered stock + Retained Earnings
-some DCA companies have strong net earnings but -ve ROE don't need to have retained earnings. 
But insolvent companies only have -ve ROE so be careful
Note: if both ROE and Reserves/free cash flow are increasing then management is using Reserves efficiently
if freecash flow is -ve due to heavy expansion and ROE is increasing in the coming years then company is profiting from capacity expansion
Traps: buyback can inflate ROE, companies recently separated from parent companies can have huge ROE
avg 5yrs ROCE:
-ROE might not be a appropriate measure for companies with varied capital structure bcoz companies can boost ROE by taking high debt
EPS CAGR:
EPS trend : upward/downward/constant
highest EPS in past 10yrs?


**PRESENT:
BUSINESS TYPE: 
BUSINESS MODEL: 
i.e how does the money flow from customers to shareholders(financial statements analysis can be useful)
PRODUCT/SERVICES PORTFOLIO:
REVENUE MODEL:
 clients diversification(if B2B):
 products share:
REVENUE GEOGRAPHY: india
Globally competetive company:
market share:
market size: small/large (most imp if a company is a monopoly)
PEER competetiors :
how do peers provide competetion : strong moats/geographical expansion/innovative products/capex spending
POSITION IN PEERS :
will it be easy for new entrants in this industry either for big brands or Novice companies: 


**FUTURE : why/how does the company grow? 
SECTOR GROWTH RATE: check in sector growth
MANAGEMENT VISION:
OPPURTUNITTIES FOR SUSTAINABLE GROWTH:
--working capital cyle improving and least among peers
--sector growth: +ve/-ve/constant
--source of earnings: business(volume increase/price increase/cost cutting with very little sales increase/M&A) OR accounting tricks(increased other income, lower amort and dep charges)
due to voume increase(most sustainable of all) => then what is source of capital : debt/equity/retained earnings(cheapest and most preferred)
How to verify? compare sales growth % with net profit growth % ?
Note - there should be little difference if not then better to probe
due to price increase => sustainable only if company has a strong MOAT, also this has to be accompained with sales increase
else after some years your company growth rate = inflation and the purpose of investing in stock markets to beat infalation is gone
Also if sales are not increasing then demand has dried up OR competetiors taking away market share - Both are bad situations
due to cost cutting => good but it is non-sustainable bcoz at some point cost cutting becomes stagnant
due to lot of M&A => look at standalone statement and also invest only if the parent company is strong and is doing
 acquistions to further strengthen rather than the parent company being a normal one and acquiring to sustain.
due to accounting tricks => not sustainable and can be a fraud company
INFACT earnings source is more than earnings itself bcoz earnings source decides whether the earning growth is sustainable or not
--Horizontal growth oppurtunities: Global footprint/Tieups/buying new companies etc
--Vertical growth oppurtunities: selling more goods&services/raising prices/selling new products
--Steps Taken To Capture Oppurtunity:
--WILL THE PRODUCTS/SERVICES be in demand for next 10yrs:
--CAN IT SUSTAIN PEER COMPETITION:
--are the MOATs breakable: yes/no
if NO then steps taken to strengthen the MOATS further :

******* Management ******
FOCUS: should be on growth and shareholders instead of personal profits
- promoter pledging? 
- promoter shareholding pattern : constant/ decreasing/ increasing
-compnesation: variable based on permonance or fixed ?
Note: compnesation of the management in the low time should be less compared to high times 
- remuneration acc to MCA limits: 
- perks of management? very high / less
- type of stock options :ESOP(not recorded as an expense even though it is)/RSU(preferred as it is recorded an expense)
Note: make sure to check outstanding shares growth YOY. any company issuing ESPOs abnormally and having a YOY outstanding shares 
increase > 10%, doesn't care about shareholders
- does the executives hold any stocks?
Note - if yes then that motivates them to act in favour of shareholders
- related party transactions: 
Note: should only be for business purposes and not to executives family
-Board of directors filled with management family members?
if yes then there is no one to question the management and put the compnay on a winning track
Note: board of directors is a group of individuals elected to represent shareholders and can question and fire the management
- involved in scams/cases: 
- CFO /auditor recently resigned/ continously resigning: 
- spoke about share price instead of business in news/annual reports/conf calls: 
- management should do what they say. did they do so?: to be found in annual reports(letter to shareholders) & conference calls
-management should be completely transparent to its shareholders, "we don't disclose" is not what we want to hear
Note: should admit the mistakes honestly
** skill test:
- skills relevant to industry: yes
- experience over > 10 yrs : yes
- mindset/vision: growth via rural penetration/global foot print
- how are reserves used - bank balance/M&A/dividends/buyback/reinvesting in own business/investing in other DCA companies
if dividends are paid - shareholders need to pay tax on it
so better to invest on other DCA businesses or even better is to buyback shares from extra cash as this financial engineering
concept increases shareholders wealth without paying any tax.
Note: buying back shares at a premium valuation is not the best use of capital, buying back is useful only if the 
shares are bought at lower/fairprices.

****** valuation *****
Talk about valuations only if the above factors are strong, else no point in buying the company

*VALUATION RATIOS - talk about valuations only if business and management analysis is positive
PE < 25(govt 10 yr bond yield) ? 
High P/E => earnings may be less due to recession or one time costs OR market is paying premium as they believe earnings will increase at a faster rate
check PEG to confirm , premium is justified only when PEG < 2
Note: PE of a company might be less bcoz of the riskiness, cyclical nature, capex intensive and more capital requirement etc
Low PE => inflated earnings due to one time income or any other manipulation OR any fundamentally wrong with the company
Also PE < Industry PE?
-PE is generally compared with peers PE, but PE for other companies is based on their financial condition, hence not a great measure
PE < 5yr median PE? also check the historical PE range (most reliable approach for established firms)
-for young companies it might not be relevant as they business outlook and financials might have changed
PEG ratio: 
-find out the earnings growth rate and check if they are releastic (check source of earnings section in FUTURE)
PB: 
Note: imp for capex intensive(fixed assets - old value) and financial firms(liquid assets - current value),makes less sense for service based companies
Also don't forget to look at goodwill when you are valueing a firm based on PB value
Bargain: if ROE is consistently high(i.e equity/book value is increasing) and PB value is less compared to peers
PB - NA for a B2C company,if PB is applicable check ROA
EV/EBITDA:
EV/EBITDA < 10 - excellent company
EV/EBITDA < 14 - can be considered
EV/EBITDA > 14 - high valuation
EV/EBITDA < industry EV/EBITDA and compare it with peers of same size
cash return: free cashflow as a % of EV?
EV= market_cap + long_term debt - cash
compare this yield/cash_return with longterm bonds/FDs => if it is almost similar and the earnings of the company is bound to grow
hence better to invest in the company else invest in the FDs or bonds

**Problem with valuation ratios
1)they are relative - i.e they are least useful if used alone and are generally used to compare with peers
2)They don't tell anything about value(i.e how much the firm is actually worth) - ratios are based on price and they only 
tell u how much price an investor is paying wrt peers.
3)Business should be compared with peers but valuation should ONLY be based on instrinsic value of that company alone and not based on peer position
why: PE for other companies is based on their financial condition and business outlook, lets say a company has poor outlook and
financials then PE is obviously less and the company we are looking at may seem like overvalued but looking at intrinsic value it
may be undervalued and might miss the oppurtunity assuming it is overvalued
so we can't say whether the company is overvalued/undervalued


If cash flow regular? 
calculate DCF valuation : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MuOiZa6lAnofjJcGEBPVoiZuNG-mGE3Eo4DWu3hdQF8/edit#gid=0
    Market cap < DCF valuation, both PE and earnings are less?, check valuation ratios - stock undervalued, hence buy it
    Market cap ~= DCF - fairly valued, check valuation ratios
    Market cap > DCF - stock overvalued (put in watchlist and do averaging down/up based on the company)

Else 
	buy based on relative valuations mentioned in advanced/company_valuation.txt


****** OVERALL SUMMARY *******
status: overvalued/undervalued/fairly valued
undervalued: lumpsum
overvalued: 
Note: even if a company has DCA, if you buy at high price the returns will be like a mediocre company
1)SIP via averaging up, increase SIP if price falls due to external factors
2)wait for the bear markets 
3)if company faces a temporary solvable problem , share price go down and you can grab
fairly valued: 50% of lumpsum based on the price trend

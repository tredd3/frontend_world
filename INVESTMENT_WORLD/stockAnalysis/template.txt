****** valuation *****
Talk about valuations only if the above factors are strong, else no point in buying the company

*VALUATION RATIOS
PE:
PE < 20(medium) ? 
High P/E => earnings are less OR market is paying  premium as they believe earnings will increase at a faster rate
check PEG to confirm , premium is justified only when PEG < 2
Low PE => any fundamentally wrong with the company - check
Also PE < Industry PE?
PE < 5yr median PE?
PEG ratio: 
PB: 
PB - NA for a B2C company,if PB is applicable check ROA
EV/EBITDA:
EV/EBITDA < 10 - excellent company
EV/EBITDA < 14 - can be considered
EV/EBITDA > 14 - high valuation
EV/EBITDA < industry EV/EBITDA and compare it with peers of same size


If cash flow regular? 
calculate DCF valuation : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MuOiZa6lAnofjJcGEBPVoiZuNG-mGE3Eo4DWu3hdQF8/edit#gid=0
    Market cap < DCF valuation, both PE and earnings are less?, check valuation ratios - stock undervalued, hence buy it
    Market cap ~= DCF - fairly valued, check valuation ratios
    Market cap > DCF - stock overvalued (put in watchlist and do averaging down/up based on the company)

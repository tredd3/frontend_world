other income % contribution to net profit
did it beat NIFTY in past 10yrs? 
continous dividend payment history: yes/no


*BALANCE SHEET:
look reserves and net profit for every year - any abnormality(like reserves decreasing and profit increasing)observed ?
also look at the notes for reserves
current assets > current liabilities
check cash/market_cap : if > 50% buy
check if Accounts Receivable is significant compared to sales:
 if yes there might be a default risk - also u need to reiterate on the company, as it has liberal credit policy
inventory abnormally large ? 
 if yes there might be a loss


*INCOME STATEMENT:
--source of earnings: 
infact earnings source is more than earnings itself

--GPM higher(>40%) and consistent or growing over last 10yrs? :
if yes it is an early sign that the company has some kind of MOAT/competitive advantage over its peers
if GPM<20 then the company is in a fierecely competetive industry and any company in such industry with out any competitive adv can't make you rich

--operating expenses (factors that can strip off competettive advantage from the company and eat away profits)
1)R&D spending(check in operating expenses) % wrt to net profit and operating expenses
does the compnay consistently needs to spend on R&D for survival?
if yes : R&D cost should be negligible or < 5% of gross profit
2)sales and admin expenses(check in operating expenses)
should be consistently < 50%-60% of gross profit depending on the peers - indicating brand/MOAT power
if it increases heavily every year then company is trying to fight its competetion
if the company incuding its peers consistently have >=100% of gross profit then the industry is highly competetive
3)interest costs(can be found in p&l or financing cashflows)
interest should be <10-15% of operating income/profit. (but it depends on industry and its peers)
company with high debt means either it in highly competetive industry and it needs debt to finance the capex for survival
OR it has acquired other company by taking debt
NOTE: Generally in a given industry company with lowest ratio of interest to operating income has a competetive advantage


-- strength check: What are the earnings/situation of the company in 2008 and 2020 crisis?
however it completely depends on the industry. it is possible that all companies in the sector have done poorly

-- amort/dep as a % of fixed assets: 
-- amort/dep as a % of gross profit/operating: 
companies with DCA has <10% and also much lesser compared to peers

--other income: significant compared to operating income? like >15-20%
if yes: since it is non operating and  non recurring income, it should be removed from calculation
if no: we can ignore

-- durability check: does net profit have a upward trend?
if yes, are you sure it will continue
if no, are you sure of the trend reversal - very rare case trend reversal happens
Note: net profit upward trend is important compared to EPS upward trend bcoz EPS can be increased by share repurchase
--NPM consistent/increasing ?
company with DCA generally has NPM > 20% 
if NPM < 10% then company belongs is a highly competetive industry where no one has a durable competettive advantage (DCA)

--EPS
does eps have a upward trend or it has lot of fluctuations?
stay away from cyclical stocks for long term


*CASH FLOW:
Capex(check in Cash flow from investing) % wrt to net profit
capex is good as it useful to capture market share. but capex increase using debt is risky

*OPERATIONAL RATIOS:
quick ratio:
current ratio:
Debt/Equity(keep in mind the industry - bank, energy, machinery ect have high debt): 
if D/E > 0 - check the debt position of peers and ICR of the company

*PROFITIABILITY RATIOS:
GPM: constant/increaing(profit increasing?)/decreasing(sales increasing?)
OPM: constant/increaing(profit increasing?)/decreasing(sales increasing?)

****** valuation *****
Talk about valuations only if the above factors are strong, else no point in buying the company

*VALUATION RATIOS
PE:
PE < 20(medium) ? 
High P/E => earnings are less OR market is paying  premium as they believe earnings will increase at a faster rate
check PEG to confirm , premium is justified only when PEG < 2
Low PE => any fundamentally wrong with the company - check
Also PE < Industry PE?
PE < 5yr median PE?
PEG ratio: 
PB: 
PB - NA for a B2C company,if PB is applicable check ROA
EV/EBITDA:
EV/EBITDA < 10 - excellent company
EV/EBITDA < 14 - can be considered
EV/EBITDA > 14 - high valuation
EV/EBITDA < industry EV/EBITDA and compare it with peers of same size


If cash flow regular? 
calculate DCF valuation : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MuOiZa6lAnofjJcGEBPVoiZuNG-mGE3Eo4DWu3hdQF8/edit#gid=0
    Market cap < DCF valuation, both PE and earnings are less?, check valuation ratios - stock undervalued, hence buy it
    Market cap ~= DCF - fairly valued, check valuation ratios
    Market cap > DCF - stock overvalued (put in watchlist and do averaging down/up based on the company)

**STRENGTH
MOAT/competitive advantage?
 check summaries/MOATS.txt
 unique product/service : 
 low cost buyer and seller, i.e does the company make margins from volumes?
is it durable ?
 look for consistency in numbers in  financial statements. 
does the company have long term earning power?
 even though the company has DCA over its peers, if the company doesn't have earning power bcoz of the less
  market size/weak industry future/govt rules etc, then it doesn't make sense to buy
i.e can the company earnings grow for next 10yrs at a good growth rate?
users consistently need the product/service?
globally competitive?
circle of competence?
vertical/horizontal growth oppurtunities?

** Red flags - those that stop you from investment/ think you twice before investing

**** Company ****
**PAST: financials

https://www.tijorifinance.com/company/zydus-wellness/
other income % contribution to net profit
did it beat NIFTY in past 10yrs? 
continous dividend payment history: yes/no


*BALANCE SHEET:
**assets
--current assets > current liabilities ?
Note: some DCA companies might not have CA>CL but their earning power and DCA helps them sail through
--cash increasing? 
is the cash generated bcoz of operations? 
Note: check last 10yrs balance sheet to find out
--check cash/market_cap : if > 50% buy

--does both inventory and net profit increasing ? 
if no: there might be a price risk as inventory is becoming obselete

--check if Accounts Receivable is significant compared to sales over the years:
if yes there might be a default risk - also company might be in a highly competetive industry and to gain advantage , 
 it might be giving more liberty to its customers
Also if the same thing is done by their peers then it will also have profit risk

--plant and equipment cost should be either constant/decreasing/increaing at low rate? 
if it is increaing consistently at a higher rate then the company is investing from it reserves or by taking debt to beat the competettion
this will eat up your profit as this extra money can be spent on some profitable ventures and hence you shouldn't invest

--long term investments:
probe this section in annual reports to understand whether the management have invested in companies with DCA or medicore businesses
in a highly competetive industry
Note: increase in longterm investment doesn't mean the market value of investment has gone up rather it means every year company
is investing in some business


**liabilities
--short term debt:
if debt is more check cash in balance sheet and verify whether it is a long term debt or short term debt
avoild companies with short term debt > longterm debt
-if short term debt is high compared to longterm debt and no cash in balance sheet, the company has to sell its assets to 
cover the short term debt.

--long term debt:
usually DCA companies have zero or very low long term debt
if they have a longterm debt it should be payable using the net profits of next 3-4 yrs
Note: if the company has DCA and also a lot of debt then better to invest in bonds of that company and not stock, as the company
will be focused on paying interest and not on growing the company

--preferred stock ? 
preferred stock is not preferred to have in balance sheet - it is expensive money

--retained earnings: very very important
consistent growth and growth rate of retained earnings implies company has a DCA
also check how is the company using retained earnings - infact it is very important than the former
it should invest in other DCA/profitable businesses, which inturn can increase their retained earnings and the process goes on

--look reserves and net profit for every year - any abnormality(like reserves decreasing and profit increasing)observed ?
also look at the notes for reserves


*INCOME STATEMENT:
--source of earnings: 
infact earnings source is more than earnings itself

--GPM higher(>40%) and consistent or growing over last 10yrs? :
if yes it is an early sign that the company has some kind of MOAT/competitive advantage over its peers
if GPM<20 then the company is in a fierecely competetive industry and any company in such industry with out any competitive adv can't make you rich

--operating expenses (factors that can strip off competettive advantage from the company and eat away profits)
1)R&D spending(check in operating expenses) % wrt to net profit and operating expenses
does the compnay consistently needs to spend on R&D for survival?
if yes : R&D cost should be negligible or < 5% of gross profit
2)sales and admin expenses(check in operating expenses)
should be consistently < 50%-60% of gross profit depending on the peers - indicating brand/MOAT power
if it increases heavily every year then company is trying to fight its competetion
if the company incuding its peers consistently have >=100% of gross profit then the industry is highly competetive
3)interest costs(can be found in p&l or financing cashflows)
interest should be <10-15% of operating income/profit. (but it depends on industry and its peers)
company with high debt means either it in highly competetive industry and it needs debt to finance the capex for survival
OR it has acquired other company by taking debt
NOTE: Generally in a given industry company with lowest ratio of interest to operating income has a competetive advantage


-- strength check: What are the earnings/situation of the company in 2008 and 2020 crisis?
however it completely depends on the industry. it is possible that all companies in the sector have done poorly

-- amort/dep as a % of fixed assets: 
-- amort/dep as a % of gross profit/operating: 
companies with DCA has <10% and also much lesser compared to peers

--other income: significant compared to operating income? like >15-20%
if yes: since it is non operating and  non recurring income, it should be removed from calculation
if no: we can ignore

-- durability check: does net profit have a upward trend?
if yes, are you sure it will continue
if no, are you sure of the trend reversal - very rare case trend reversal happens
Note: net profit upward trend is important compared to EPS upward trend bcoz EPS can be increased by share repurchase
--NPM consistent/increasing ?
company with DCA generally has NPM > 20% 
if NPM < 10% then company belongs is a highly competetive industry where no one has a durable competettive advantage (DCA)

--EPS
does eps have a upward trend or it has lot of fluctuations?
stay away from cyclical stocks for long term


*CASH FLOW:
Capex(check in Cash flow from investing) % wrt to net profit
capex is good as it useful to capture market share. but capex increase using debt is risky

*OPERATIONAL RATIOS:
quick ratio:
current ratio >1 is preferred:
but the importance of this ratio is high in deciding liquidity for avg companies but not so important for DCA companies, as 
 DCA companies often have current ratio < 1 and their earning power is so high that it doesn't matter
Debt/Equity(keep in mind the industry - bank, energy, machinery ect have high debt): 
if D/E > 0 - check the debt position of peers and ICR of the company and interest expense as a % of operating profit
Also some times D/E can be misleading as many DCA companies don't need to have retained earnings/equity in their balance sheet
rather they use it to buyback shares which goes into treasury stock section.
Hence it is recommended to check the debt along with D/E


*PROFITIABILITY RATIOS:
GPM: constant/increaing(profit increasing?)/decreasing(sales increasing?)
OPM: constant/increaing(profit increasing?)/decreasing(sales increasing?)
avg 5yrs ROE: 
avg 5yrs ROCE:
EPS CAGR:
EPS trend : upward/downward/constant
highest EPS in past 10yrs?

****** valuation *****
Talk about valuations only if the above factors are strong, else no point in buying the company

*VALUATION RATIOS
PE:
PE < 20(medium) ? 
High P/E => earnings are less OR market is paying  premium as they believe earnings will increase at a faster rate
check PEG to confirm , premium is justified only when PEG < 2
Low PE => any fundamentally wrong with the company - check
Also PE < Industry PE?
PE < 5yr median PE?
PEG ratio: 
PB: 
PB - NA for a B2C company,if PB is applicable check ROA
EV/EBITDA:
EV/EBITDA < 10 - excellent company
EV/EBITDA < 14 - can be considered
EV/EBITDA > 14 - high valuation
EV/EBITDA < industry EV/EBITDA and compare it with peers of same size


If cash flow regular? 
calculate DCF valuation : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MuOiZa6lAnofjJcGEBPVoiZuNG-mGE3Eo4DWu3hdQF8/edit#gid=0
    Market cap < DCF valuation, both PE and earnings are less?, check valuation ratios - stock undervalued, hence buy it
    Market cap ~= DCF - fairly valued, check valuation ratios
    Market cap > DCF - stock overvalued (put in watchlist and do averaging down/up based on the company)

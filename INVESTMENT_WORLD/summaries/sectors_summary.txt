**** keep in mind ******
Sector types - cyclical/defensice/growth/extinction
Sector investment - needs continuous monitoring
Note: MAJORITY I.e 75% of NIFTY sectors: Banking/Finance , Technology and Oil & Gas 
selecting a sector is always a top down approach
sector comprises of many industries

1)BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES
Industry: Banking
cyclical - but behaves like hybrid of cyclical and defensive
keep an eye on NPAs
still india has a scope for penetration
not globally competetive
valuation: 
NPA - must be less
CASA,NIM,ROA,ROE -Â must be more
higher CASA indicates current and saving account deposits are more compared to time deposits => low cost funds for banks =>high NIM
don't look at debt 


Industry: Insurance (mostly avoid but if there is an exceptional company u can consider holding it)
revenue: 
1)recurring premiums and fees
2)invest the pooled assets and get the profit(kind of similar to banks)
expense:
1)insurance selling costs via agents/banks
2)benefits to shareholders
complex products and financial statements
It takes years for Insurance companies to know whether it made money on the policy or not - bcoz the life expectancy , 
future investment value and the time for which an individual will hold the policy is unknown
Also bcoz of the above reasons Insurance company cannot effectively price the policy
MOAT CHECK: weak moats in general
brand
distribution network
diverse products
established relationship with corporate consumers
consistent ROE and ROCE above 15%
annual premium growth rate not too high
credit rating
investment portfolio quality
low cost provider with volumes?
did it survive a disaster in the past(2008, 2021)
shouldn't sell unprofitable insurance policies
unique product: i.e providing insurance for those items which competetitiors don't provide
RISK:
extremely competetive - difficult to build a moat for longterm bcoz of commodity products which can be easily replaced
mostly a no MOAT business with thin margins, hence acquistions are needed for sustainace
big annuity business - risky investment as the exposure to equities is more
no pricing power : public always prefer low cost products, IRDAI regulates the premiums prices and puts a cap
some competetitiors price the policies so low and are ready to take losses in balance sheet to gain market share that will
eventually effect other firms profits. e.g LIC
cyclicality: even though it is a mature business since the profits are tied to market returns, in the bull market returns are good
and premiums are less but in during crash/bear markets premiums need to be increased to make profits but if competetitiors still keep 
it low then the firm suffers


Industry: Asset management
revenue: % of recurring investments/SIPs
major expense : compensation of managers
keep an eye on operating expense
economies of scale: excellent (as it doesn't require more managers when the asset size to manage increases)
no capex, R&D and debt needed
loss is beared by customer unlike bank and isnurance business
MOAT check:
market share (smaller firms find it difficult to sustain the competetion)
more assets: total AUM YOY growth and absolute numbers compared to peers
longterm solid track recored( required to attract investors)
diversification of products(investment in multiple asset classes)
diversification of investors
uniqueness of products if any like international investing, tax saving funds etc
stickiness of assets(money that stays in the firm even when times are tough)
AUM growth reason ? market prices/ net inflows are more
check for net inflows > net outflows in both bull and bear markets
CAMS(back office work) - only profitable if it deals with scale - need to spend on Technology
RISK:
extremely competetive industry - bcoz of high margins and economies of scale, lot of firms enter in to this business
people might stop SIPs and invest directly in stocks

Industry: capital markets : Depositories/Exchanges/Registrars etc

2)IT - defensive
globally competetive
services based: no significant cost
product based: R&D costs
MOAT: narrow moat with most of the the firms
low entry barrier - high margins

3)pharma - defensive
globally competetive
R&D heavy
MOATS: Patent

4)FMCG - defensive
inflation of raw materials
margins depend on middle class purchasing power

5)Energy
Industry: petrol
heavily relies on imports
capex heavy
no pricing power - price is globally decided

Industry :Gas

6)Power -Thermal/hydroelectric/renewable

7)Infra - cyclical

8)Telecom
heavily relies on imports - atmnirbhar bharat and PLI schemes can be game changers
capex heavy

9)Agriculture

10)commodities sector
no pricing power
cyclical - high volatility
MOATS: low cost provider(high volumes)

11)Automobile
R&D heavy

12)chemical

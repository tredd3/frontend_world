**** keep in mind ******
Sector types - cyclical/defensice/growth/extinction
Sector investment - needs continuous monitoring
Note: MAJORITY I.e 75% of NIFTY sectors: Banking/Finance , Technology and Oil & Gas 
selecting a sector is always a top down approach
sector comprises of many industries

1)BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES
Industry: Banking
cyclical - but behaves like hybrid of cyclical and defensive
keep an eye on NPAs
still india has a scope for penetration
not globally competetive
valuation: 
NPA - must be less
CASA,NIM,ROA,ROE -Â must be more
higher CASA indicates current and saving account deposits are more compared to time deposits => low cost funds for banks =>high NIM
don't look at debt 


Industry: Insurance (mostly avoid but if there is an exceptional company u can consider holding it)
revenue: 
1)recurring premiums and fees
2)invest the pooled assets and get the profit(kind of similar to banks)
expense:
1)insurance selling costs via agents/banks
2)benefits to shareholders
complex products and financial statements
It takes years for Insurance companies to know whether it made money on the policy or not - bcoz the life expectancy , 
future investment value and the time for which an individual will hold the policy is unknown
Also bcoz of the above reasons Insurance company cannot effectively price the policy
MOAT CHECK: weak moats in general
brand
distribution network
diverse products
established relationship with corporate consumers
consistent ROE and ROCE above 15%
annual premium growth rate not too high
credit rating
investment portfolio quality
low cost provider with volumes?
did it survive a disaster in the past(2008, 2021)
shouldn't sell unprofitable insurance policies
unique product: i.e providing insurance for those items which competetitiors don't provide
RISK:
extremely competetive - difficult to build a moat for longterm bcoz of commodity products which can be easily replaced
mostly a no MOAT business with thin margins, hence acquistions are needed for sustainace
big annuity business - risky investment as the exposure to equities is more
no pricing power : public always prefer low cost products, IRDAI regulates the premiums prices and puts a cap
some competetitiors price the policies so low and are ready to take losses in balance sheet to gain market share that will
eventually effect other firms profits. e.g LIC
cyclicality: even though it is a mature business since the profits are tied to market returns, in the bull market returns are good
and premiums are less but in during crash/bear markets premiums need to be increased to make profits but if competetitiors still keep 
it low then the firm suffers


Industry: Asset management
revenue: % of recurring investments/SIPs
major expense : compensation of managers
keep an eye on operating expense
economies of scale: excellent (as it doesn't require more managers when the asset size to manage increases)
no capex, R&D and debt needed
loss is beared by customer unlike bank and isnurance business
MOAT check:
market share (smaller firms find it difficult to sustain the competetion)
more assets: total AUM YOY growth and absolute numbers compared to peers
longterm solid track recored( required to attract investors)
diversification of products(investment in multiple asset classes)
diversification of investors
uniqueness of products if any like international investing, tax saving funds etc
stickiness of assets(money that stays in the firm even when times are tough)
AUM growth reason ? market prices/ net inflows are more
check for net inflows > net outflows in both bull and bear markets
CAMS(back office work) - only profitable if it deals with scale - need to spend on Technology
RISK:
extremely competetive industry - bcoz of high margins and economies of scale, lot of firms enter in to this business
people might stop SIPs and invest directly in stocks

Industry: capital markets : Depositories/Exchanges/Registrars etc

2)IT - defensive
globally competetive
services based: no significant cost
product based: R&D costs
MOAT: narrow moat with most of the the firms
low entry barrier - high margins

3)pharma - defensive
globally competetive
R&D heavy
MOATS: Patent

4)FMCG - defensive - saviour in bear markets
business modal: company - retailers/wholsellers/distributors - customers
typically moves wrt to GDP and sometimes even slower than GDP - Hence they can ONLY be profitable in long term
Demand is almost static and hence profits are dependent on inflation
generally available at high valuations(bcoz of brand power and strong financials)
so while using DCF make sure cashflow rate is acc to gdp rate if not slightly higher
highly mature companies so very less growth strategies:(generally a mix of strategies is used)
-innovation:launch new products and capture market share (but new products has to click)
even when new prodcuts becomes popular still the revenue growth will be in single digit
R&D is important bcoz differentiated products boosts ur pricing power
-acquistion:acquire others business and grow(its better to acquire businesses in the same industry so that existing infrastructure can help )
also it depends on which company u have acquired and what price
-operating cost reduction
whatever the strategy you follow revenues can't grow above GDP, so company must focus on cost cutting like occasional restructuring
look for consistent low operating expenses and high OPM wrt peers
Note:cost cutting shouldn't happen in ads, bcoz brand may disappear from people's mind
-sell products overseas
there are countries which are in a growth spree and selling products in that area leads to double digit growth
e.g: cococola has a single digit growth in US but in abroad it has double digit growth
Economic Moats:
economies of scale(sell low cost product by spreading expenses on volumes)
brand recognition by customers + market share
strong distribution network(dedicated distributers even make it better)
Look out for:
*cash machines - check how company is utilising cash (look at dividend payout ratio, buybacks etc)
*are they building brand? - look at sales in comparison with ad spending, if the company is not spending on ads inspite of lesser sales
then the company might be focused on earnings and not on brand building (company should promote the brand but not products with low prices)
*innovation - is the company coming up with new flavor of exisiting product or completely innovative products
new flavor products is preferred by companies bcoz consumers are aware of the brand 
but for a completely innovative product to click it has to educate the customers, spend on ads and it has to have unique features and
substantial advantage over its substitutes(look out for companies that has launched new prodcuts successfully over the years)
*company has to cut costs but the growth shouldn't depend on cost cutting alone. It has to be accompained with sales growth 
bcoz cost cutting can happen to a certain extent after which it is difficult to cut costs
Risks:
inflation of raw materials
margins depend on middle class purchasing power
pricing power is questionable because middlemen like walmart and amazon have a huge customer attraction and can decide pricing


5)Energy
Industry: petrol
heavily relies on imports
capex heavy
no pricing power - price is globally decided

Industry :Gas

6)Power -Thermal/hydroelectric/renewable

7)Infra - cyclical

8)Telecom
heavily relies on imports - atmnirbhar bharat and PLI schemes can be game changers
capex heavy

9)Agriculture

10)commodities sector
no pricing power
cyclical - high volatility
MOATS: low cost provider(high volumes)

11)Automobile
R&D heavy

12)chemical

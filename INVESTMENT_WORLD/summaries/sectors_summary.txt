**** keep in mind ******
Sector types - cyclical/defensice/growth/extinction
Sector investment - needs continuous monitoring
Note: MAJORITY I.e 75% of NIFTY sectors: Banking/Finance , Technology and Oil & Gas 
selecting a sector is always a top down approach
sector comprises of many industries

//FOCUS ON:
Below are the sectors where companies can have wider moats and are highly profitable in the long run
AMC
Business services - tech based
Healthcare
media/communications


1)BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES
--Industry: Banking(still india has a scope for penetration)
cyclical - but behaves like hybrid of cyclical and defensive
Main business: Borrowing and lending
Other services: invoice discounting, insurance, MF sale, escrow accounts, 
Revenue model = net interest income(main business) + non-interest income (other services)
low cost of borrowing - bcoz they are regulated by RBI and backed by Govt
Balance sheet scrutiny is very important
A mortgage is usually a loan sanctioned against an immovable asset like a house or a commercial property. The lender keeps the 
 asset as collateral until the borrower repays the total loan amount. 
Banks losses must be covered by earnings , if not reserves , if losses > (earnings + reserves), they end up eating equity
Look for:
product/services portfolio depth and reach to public
Geograpical spread - good to have for risk management
loan diversification (to multiple sectors/industries/companies) - avoid banks where most loans are in riskier sectors
savings and other low cost deposits trend
Prudent recovery and collection procedures
low NPAs(for loans),charge-off rates(for credit cards) and delinquency rates(late payments) compared to peers
*delinquency rates are imp bcoz they can turn in to a NPA
*charge-off rate is a measure that shows the percentage of defaulted credit card balances in comparison to the total amount of credit outstanding
good provisioning wrt to NPAs
In this industry growth cannot be significantly faster than peers(if yes then it can lead to troubles , hence deep scrutiny is needed)
Must be Complient with Basel norms (for both liquidity and risk frameworks)
good banks make sure that the duration of long term liabilities is same as that of long term loans
Financials:
Should have strong Capital base compared to peers(check balance sheet)
operating costs and non-interest expense should less as a % of revenue
ROE and ROA must be high (provided provisions ~= GNPA )
CASA,NIM -Â must be more
higher CASA indicates current and saving account deposits are more compared to time deposits => low cost funds for banks =>high NIM
NPA - must be less
Good if Non interest income continously growing(extra income for bank) But this should complement interest income and not replace it
P/B between 2-3 is a good bet to buy strong banks
Moats:
Capital intensive business (difficult for new player to enter or the existing player to became No.1)
Brand(for attracting deposits and talent)
Size (Large banks have prudent risk management framework and access to Capital markets)
Economies of Scale(take advantage of larger distribution network)
Switching costs
Risk:
increase in NPAs during recession
not globally competetive 


Industry: capital markets : Depositories/Exchanges/Registrars etc


2)IT - defensive - globally competetive - high margins
highly competettive industry - low barriers to entry - high barriers to success
less capital required to build a software
like FMCG they generate a lot of cash
Generally have clean balance sheets with Zero debt
Excellent growth prospects bcoz businesses keep upgrading with latest software that can make business run smoothly and cut costs
services based: no significant cost
product based: R&D costs
Attractive segments: Security(antivirus, firewalls), IOT, AI, ML, BlockChain
LOOK FOR:
niche players like Adobe who has low competetion and strong Moats
Economies of Scale(once a software is developed revenue from new customer goes to bottom line)
company with Large customer base (that are Loyal to the company)
Great management(especially that don't give away ESPOs easily)
FINANCIALS:
License revenue(new softwares sold) trend should be increasing in general and also as a % of sales
Deffered revenue (cash recieved by the company even before service delivery) - indicated strong future revenues
if License revenues and Deffered revenues are declining then company's business has started to slow down
excellent track records in both the economy cycles (sales and profit margins)
MOATS:
narrow moat with most of the the firms
high switching costs (most of the customers train their employees and they can't spend again and again)
Network effect (certain products are used by large no of people)
Brand Name (people don't buy random software due to security issues)
RISK:
today's winner can be tomorrow's loser if the competetitior can develop a better product at a better price
don't invest blindly if u don't find a MOAT and not getting at a discount to intrinsic value(bcoz the pace at which technology is 
growing it is difficult to predict how software firms look like in the future)


3)HEALTHCARE - defensive - globally competetive
Industry : hospitals, Pharma, biotech, medical devices, diagnosis centers, Health insurance
wide economic moated industries - pharma(bcoz of patents), medical devices(bcoz of switching costs)
//2 types of drug companies - generic(copy cats producing drugs at low prices in high volumes) and branded(innovators and patent holder)
Note: ironically generic drug companies are gaining popularity as they bring down healthcare costs significantly
drug development process:
- preclinical testing(on animals)
- human clinical trials - phae 1, 2 and 3
- once phase 3 trial is successful then the company files application with all the regualtory bodies in the world
- fate of the drug is literally in the hands of Regulatory authorities
/if rejected then it back to starting point figuring out what went wrong and fixing them and going through the whole testing 
and approval process again which might take years
/if accepted : company enjoys monopoly for that particular drug for about 20 yrs but as the patent is filed as soon as the 
drug/chemical compound is identified, 8-10 yrs is eaten up during testing and approval years
-once the patent is expired drug now becomes generic which means other generic drug companies copy the composition, manufacture it
 and sell them at extremely low prices affecting the parent company which innopvated the product
//Biotech firm: this industry runs on probability and luck
discover drugs using cellular and molecular process rather than chemical process(like pharma companies)
high risk, requires lot of luck and expertise - better to avoid
//Medical devices firm:
catering to old population (cardiac and orthopedic surgeries)
patent protection for instruments/devices
having high switching costs(both in terms of surgeons training and costs to hospital managment) and 
long term clinical histories - acts as barriers for new entrants
pricing power as the costs are covered by insurance companies(devices firms comfortably increases price every year)
low regulatory risk: improvements in devices industry is evolutionary, meaning next product verions are made better than previous 
products, unlike in phama where improvements are revolutionary, meaning a completely new drug can replace the exisiting drugs
orthopedic devices has high switching costs but cardiac devices has low switching costs, hence companies has to spend a good amount 
on R&D to come up with a new product ans stay in the competetion.
PS: product innovation and diversification is must for these companies
//Health Insurance/Managed care:
intense regulatory pressure
it is not an attractive business bcoz of the rising healthcare costs can wipe out profits
2 types of operations: risk based(underwriting medical insurance for premiums), fee based(monitoring, claims processings etc)
fee based busniess is more predicatable and profitable bcoz rising healthcare costs are taken up by employers
limited exposure to govt funded programs is preferred because govt doesn't increase reimbursements inline with healthcare costs
MOATS: 
high entry barriers - it takes several years for developing a product through R&D, involving high startup costs and regulatory approval
 also physicians always prefer medicines/medical devices with proven track record 
Patent validity/protection - there is no competettion for price and mostly health insurance covers the costs so price 
 is also high and end customers don't care about it
significant product differentiation
Economies of scale
strong sales/marketting capabilities i.e tieups with physicians
Risks:
R&D heavy - Drug development is costly, time consuming(like 5-10 yrs) and no guarantee of success
Govt and regualatoty requirements can have deep impact on pricing power for the whole sector
Look for:
drugs with increasing sales growth(and having high potential catering to wider audience like sugar,bp, cancer,cholestral and heart related etc)
look for pharma companies with a pipeline of drugs in the clinical trials
high patent validity of drugs - if validity is less then 1 and 3 points are must
high acceptency rates with the regulators
Drug companies whose products target wider audience or significant unmet needs - can make better margins compared to niche products

Note: take Big margin of safety for Pharma companies with certain drugs making up large % of sales


4)FMCG - defensive - saviour in bear markets
business modal: company - retailers/wholsellers/distributors - customers
typically moves wrt to GDP and sometimes even slower than GDP - Hence they can ONLY be profitable in long term
Demand is almost static and hence profits are dependent on inflation
generally available at high valuations(bcoz of brand power and strong financials)
so while using DCF make sure cashflow rate is acc to gdp rate if not slightly higher
highly mature companies so very less growth strategies:(generally a mix of strategies is used)
-innovation:launch new products and capture market share (but new products has to click)
even when new prodcuts becomes popular still the revenue growth will be in single digit
R&D is important bcoz differentiated products boosts ur pricing power
-acquistion:acquire others business and grow(its better to acquire businesses in the same industry so that existing infrastructure can help )
also it depends on which company u have acquired and what price
-operating cost reduction
whatever the strategy you follow revenues can't grow above GDP, so company must focus on cost cutting like occasional restructuring
look for consistent low operating expenses and high OPM wrt peers
Note:cost cutting shouldn't happen in ads, bcoz brand may disappear from people's mind
-sell products overseas
there are countries which are in a growth spree and selling products in that area leads to double digit growth
e.g: cococola has a single digit growth in US but in abroad it has double digit growth
Economic Moats:
large market share
economies of scale(sell low cost product by spreading expenses on volumes)
brand recognition by customers + market share
strong distribution network(dedicated distributers even make it better)
Look out for:
*cash machines - check how company is utilising cash (look at dividend payout ratio and consistency in payout, buybacks etc)
*are they building brand? - look at sales in comparison with ad spending, if the company is not spending on ads inspite of lesser sales
then the company might be focused on earnings and not on brand building (company should promote the brand but not products with low prices)
*innovation - is the company coming up with new flavor of exisiting product or completely innovative products
new flavor products is preferred by companies bcoz consumers are aware of the brand 
but for a completely innovative product to click it has to educate the customers, spend on ads and it has to have unique features and
substantial advantage over its substitutes(look out for companies that has launched new prodcuts successfully over the years)
*company has to cut costs but the growth shouldn't depend on cost cutting alone. It has to be accompained with sales growth 
bcoz cost cutting can happen to a certain extent after which it is difficult to cut costs
Risks:
inflation of raw materials
because of fierce competettion the margins are generally less at around 20%
margins depend on middle class purchasing power
pricing power is questionable because middlemen like walmart and amazon have a huge customer attraction and can decide pricing


5)Energy - most countries including india heavily relies on imports
Industry: Crude oil, Natural gas, Nuclear,Thermal,hydroelectric,wind,solar
2/3 of world's energy needs are met by oil and gas
huge fixed asset costs - cyclical sector
large part of oil and gas reserves are present in middle east, hence the countries exporting oil/gas formed a group called OPEC
OPEC artificaially inflates the prices by co-ordinating and limiting supply, hence mainpulating the prices for the whole industry benefit
Reason for OPEC power: non-OPEC reserves are less and depelete faster compared to OPEC countries
no pricing power bcoz price is globally decided => biggest influencers of financial health
high fixed costs(cost of taking oil from ground to refinery is fixed irrespective of oil price) + high price volatility => AVG/NO profits for many years
Business model: upstream(exploration and drilling/extraction) => Downstream(pipelines/ships to carry to off shore refineries => service stations)
few oil companies own certain parts in the chain whereas most of the companies own the entire value chain(called integrated oil companies)
OPEC has made Upstream business more profitable than Downstream(as upstream companies will only drill when prices are high)
Industry: products/services to oil companies - drilling services,
oil companies have high profitability primarily because of OPEC support which maintains the oil prices so that oil companies 
are always profitable, but the oil services industry is highly competettive and no protectors, hence weak margins and low profitability
Reason: when oil prices are high companies use these services to quickly take final product to market to reap the profits else 
they don't want to extract the oil and wait for the prices to be normal which is not in their hands
MOATS:
oil company in countries part of OPEC
large company size and customer base
for commodity industry - economies of scale Moat is a must(especially in the Downstream by spreading the costs to large customer base)
upstream is dependent on geology and geography of company's reserves - difficult to keep cost down here but if a company does that it will have an excellent moat
high ROIC and profits compared to peers
Look For:
Integrated oil companies with good financial track record in both boom and burst years OR companies who only does upstream operations
e.g: IOL(integrated company), ONGC (only upstream company)
high fixed costs and cyclical sector hence D/E < 1 is preferred to sail through burst years
oil reserves growth or capacity wrt peers(future profit for the firms)
reserve replacement ratio > 1 , i.e company has found more than what it is extracting => reserves are increasing
if it is < 1 then company has to spend on exploration or acquistions
good dividends/effective utilisation of cash flows - as the energy sector is mature , most of the companies generate high cash flows 
Risks:
as oil and gas are commodities, OPEC is the protector but if any company comes out of OPEC and sells at will then it is a problem
Russia is the one which has largest reserves outside of OPEC countries - can be a competettion by selling at low prices and 
capturing the market share but russia economy is coupled with oil industry fortunes hence low cost selling is difficult
Clean and Cheaper energy development - Solar, wind and other forms
Note: even though these risks exists for last 20-30 yrs still oil companies have delivered excellent returns to their shareholders

6)Utilities - highly regulated sector with commodity type behaviour
Industry: electricity, water
highly regulated sector with constant demand hence it fetches guaranteed but low fixed income(i.e steady cashflows)
highly competetive(low margins) - commodity industry(no pricing power) - high fixed costs(high debt if market share is low)
electricity - generation, tranmission and distribution
/Generation - input:coal/gas/uranium/sunlinght/wind/water output:electricity, deregulated, low enetry barriers, low margins because of competettion
high operating leverage(high fixed costs, only fuel is the variable cost)
/Transmission - trasporatation of electricity from generation plants to grids via wires, regulated, high entry barriers, even though they 
operate as monopolies, still have low margins bcoz of rates regualtion
Note: wireless transmission is a game changer in this industry but is difficult to acheieve as well but not impossible
/Distribution - transmit power from grids to homes/businesses , wide moats bcoz of monopolies but low margins bcoz of regualtion
interms of wide Moats distribution > transmission > generation
Regulations:
state govt regulates structure,costs,competettion of the companies => regulation means low and steady margins
environmental agency regulates the amount of emission by power plants(mainly for coal/thermal plants) - companies must spend on
expensive upgrades to reduce emissions
nuclear agency regulates the nuclear power plants
Note: Regulated companies are safe heavens, deregulation is positive interms of pricing power but negative interms of competetion 
considering its a commodity industry with low entry barriers
Financials:
even though financial are positive they are very less making it less attractive for investors
Don't invest assuming that steady cash flow yields dividends bcoz most companies have high debt
high debt for most companies => all the steady cashflows are used in interest payment
if dividend yield is ridiculosly high => stock price is falling and company is in trouble
Look for :
companies with low debt, stablitiy in financials, operating in stable regulatory environments(i.e having monopoly/less competetion)
and companies that stay focused on its core business rather than entering in to other ventures that are out of its expertise, bcoz
this can lead to bankruptcy.
Especially if u r buy Utility company for dividends make sure to check their debt position and their payout ratio and 
dividend paying history for last 10 yrs

7)Infra - cyclical

8)Telecom - no moats, commodity type service and high regualatoty oversight 
heavily relies on imports - atmnirbhar bharat and PLI schemes can be game changers
capital intensive business
strong financial strength needed to continously improve network (hence generally have high debt)
high fixed cost business (i.e during low demand where revenues can't suffice u need to pay from reserves or even take debt)
highly competetive industry (i.e firms compete on price hence margins are thin)
highly regulated industry (firms need to be flexible enough)
any technology advantages can be easily wiped off by competetitiors by providing similar service
keep in mind to check:
debt, margins, operating leverage (extremely high compared to peers can be deadly combined with high debt)


9)Agriculture

10)industry materials
--type1: commodities sector
categories: Metals(Gold, silver, Steel,copper), Energy(Crude oil, Natural gas, Gasoline), Chemicals, Agri products, Sugar,Paper,
Raw materials,now a days mobiles have also become commodities
Business model: take raw materials => produce inputs and machinery => other firms will use it
no pricing power - globally decided
also buyers will choose based on price else commodities are the same product regardless of who makes them
high fixed costs and have many hard assets(buildings,machinery,equipment)
MOATS: 
hgh entry barriers but low margins bcoz of zero pricing power
low cost provider(with high sales volumes and low debt)
high market share(but not at the cost of profitability of the firm)
concentrated industries, where few players capture entire market share (like defense,nuclear) - where customer have no switching option
Niche/differentiated products (like speciality chemicals)
having/building products that cater to various industries
FINANCIALS:
low debt (as this is a cyclical sector, during economic downturn firms can see huge losses if they have more debt)
Asset turn over should be high compared to peers, especially FATO-fixed asset turnover(sales/fixed_assets) as firms are mostly 
depend on factories, large/heavy equipments to generate revenue
CCC: inventory days and recievables days should be consistently low
dividend paying stocks reward shareholders for holding stocks even during economy downturn
generally these kind of firms have high operating leverage bcoz of fixed costs, but extremely high operating leverage => high debt
during economy downturn to service fixed costs => share price take a hit as the earnings are used to repay loans/interests
Red flags:
D/E > 0.5, most important factor to look at as it can make the firm bankrupt
chasing market share : market share increase is not an indicator of efficiency unless FATO,TATO improves and hence companies 
should focus on profitability and not market share
more acquistions : intergration charges will be high and dilution of shares
Risk:
cyclical - high volatility 
firms generally ntake debt to cover up the fixed costs during recession => interests eating up your profits
if imports are cheaper then the frims get affected as well
Always invest in bear markets and never in bull markets as the money might get stuck in for years

--type2: value-added goods/services
Value added goods: electrical equipment, auto parts, speciality chemicals and heavy machinery(long business cycles)
wide moats for: auto parts, speciality chemicals bcoz of patents and niche products
Moat:
Those who spend on technology not only for developing a product but also for improving manufacturing efficiency, cutting production costs
R&D spending - for product innovation / product differentiation


11)Hardware (difficult to build moats and is cyclical)
industry: semiconductors, PCs, Telecom equipment, contrcat manufacturing(like DIXON)
failure and bankruptcy stories are more than success stories in this sector.so be carefull and pick wisely
growth drivers:
1)R&D, technological advances are must forcing firms to spend on R&D
2)tight coupling between hardware and software: advanced software needs hitech hardware to run smoothly
3)hardware demand is more than the economy growth
intense price competetion: over the years all the technology advancements are passed on to consumers at a lesser price
cyclical: corporates contribute more towards total hardware sales so during recession they cut down spending on upgradation
strong competetion - very less entry barriers as well
consumer spending also highly varies based on unemployment and minimum wages
contract manufacturing companies should make sure that client commit certain volume so that they can take informed decision
 on employee costs and manufacturing, else they mindlessly increase capex assuming that demand continues and when demand slows 
 down the debt level increases to service capex as revenues cannot meet the needs.
Moats:
durable market share and consistent profitability
low cost producer like dell(high sales)
niche products manufacturer(where there is scarcity of qualified staff and a new entrant possibly cannot overpower existing firms)
more diverse and unique products
large network effect like cisco where its products can be integrated with almost any hardware
superior technology advantages(but it has to be complemented by above 3 else this moat alone cannot sustain long enough)
high switching costs - especially for telecom equipment manufactures
must have flexible economics(like outsource manufacturing to contract manufacturing companies like DIXON) so whenever
 demand is low u can cut down manufacturing and save costs
cutting costs wherever possible like outsource manufacturing, eliminating third party sales middlemen etc
Keep in Mind:
check inventory turnover: old stock goes for very less price meaning large inventory pileup leads to losses if not sold fast
inventory growth shouldn't be more compared to sales growth
moated companies in this industry haven't build moat on technology advantages alone, bcoz technology in itself doesn't have any moat

12)Automobile
dependency on semiconductors and steel
R&D heavy - need to do constant innovation
Capex for manufacturing


13)Consumer services
highly competetive sector - no pricing power hence thin margins
low or no barriers to entry
outperform during periods of economic strength and underperform during econoimic weakness
industries: Restaurants(QSR,FSR), retailers(like walmart,Dmart, clothing companies)
with both parents working QSR is increasingly becoming popular
look for companies that provide quality, quick and low cost services
Retailers with CCC -ve , i.e with less inventory and more payable days are bound to be strong
recievable days are negligible for retailers as they collect cash from customers immediately
speciality retaiers like Nike, Puma ,Decatholon have MOATS for short term
only Moat: low cost supplier(economies of scale)
Risk:
changing consumer trends and firms need to match up to that
most consumer services concepts fail in the long run, so if u made investment in a speculative growth stage of a company
 then u need to continously monitor
financials might be inflated bcoz lease amount is not recorded on the balance sheet


14)Business services: 
we can find excellent businesses with wide moats
Generally companies outsource their non-core tasks to third parties to save time and money.
these taks are the core business of business services companies
i)tech based: data processing(cloud services),database providers, registry sevices, card payment network
there is competetion but growth opputunities are so high that all the competetitiors/peers enjoy a decent growth
hence in such scenarios frims don't compete on price rather they focus on capex/expansion
low capital requirements(no advertising,capex,R&D and warehouse costs)
hence look for companies with higher operating leverage, high free cash flow
high entry barriers (look for companies with large scale operations)
generally operate on long-term contracts(look for stable financial performance)
look for companies which provide a wide range of services (companies want to consolidate their purchases and maintain relations with few firms)
ii)people based: advertising, consulting and professional services(rating agencies,TCS,Accenture), staffing
money made = money billed from client  - salary paid - other costs
need to hire best talent and pay more salaries else they might lose clients(hence look for companies that hires freshers 
regulary and trains them to reduce the overall cost by paying them low salaries)
But when economy goes down these type of companies lose clients and their profits take a hit
Generally have narrow moats and highly competetive industry(so look for companies with strong client relationship)
Also look for brands that provide differentiated services at low cost - they tend to have wide MOATS
iii)hard assets based: waste management, airlines, logistics
airlines - better to avoid bcoz of their huge fixed costs and still they sell a commodity service
heavily rely on incremental fixed costs to grow their business(hence more debt in balance sheet)
Having debt is justified if the company can earn the cost of capital(to service both equity and debt) using its assets
check fixed assets turnover ratio for this Fixed-asset turnover is the ratio of sales to the value of fixed assets. 
It indicates how well the business is using its fixed assets to generate sales.
MOATS:
brand
size
barrier to entry
Trust by large companies
Note: preference - tech based > people based > hard asset based
Look at the earnings growth rate expectations from PEG ration if it is unrealestic then wait for correction at realistic growth rate
if not u can avoid the stock


15)MEDIA - revolution happening in this sector
Generate cash by producing and delivering messages to public
Industry: publishing(newspaper,magazines,novels,books), broadcast(radio,audio(music,podcasts) and video(OTT platforms,movies, shows)),
cable TV(less attractive bcoz satellite TV like Tata sky is taking over), entertainment(not attractive bcoz of one time user fee revenue model)
Revenue Models: one time user fees(watch a new movie, novel, buy CD), subsriptions(cable,newspaper,magazines and OTT), advertisement model
Best model: subsriptions (users pay for services that are delivered at much later date, hence reducing the reliance on outside capital)
economies of scale(subsription based models have high fixed costs giving them significant operating leverage,
 as companies gain market share,profit margins should increase) - avoid companies that need to do continuous CAPEX
Advertisement model - Dont rely on advertisement companies as advertising is the first cost that companies cut during recession 
Deregulations in this sector can help strong players become stronger
MOATS:
publishing and broadcasting (economies of scale by leveraging production equipment and distribution network)
 hence companies in publishing and broadcasting industries continously look for acquistions to increase market share
newspaper(monopolies)
broadcasting(generate revenue via subscriptions and ads, they can only attract ads if they have a significant market share)
intangible assets(brand names, licenses,trademarks,copyrights)
Look for companies:
monopolies or companies with huge market share
generating free cash flows
management wisely using free cashflows
willing to make sensible acquistions(smaller acquistions instead of synergy)

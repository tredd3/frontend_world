1)Banks and NBFC
cyclical - but behaves like hybrid of cyclical and defensive
keep an eye on NPAs
still india has a scope for penetration
not globally competetive
valuation: 
NPA - less
CASA,NIM,ROA,ROE -Â more
higher CASA indicates current and saving account deposits are more compared to time deposits => low cost funds for banks =>high NIM
don't look at debt 

2)FMCG

3)pharma

4)IT

5)Energy

6)commodities sector
no pricing power
cyclical - high volatility

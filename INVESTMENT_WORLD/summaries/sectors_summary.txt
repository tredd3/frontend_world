**** keep in mind ******
Sector types - cyclical/defensice/growth/extinction
Sector investment - needs continuous monitoring
Note: MAJORITY I.e 75% of NIFTY sectors: Banking/Finance , Technology and Oil & Gas 
selecting a sector is always a top down approach
sector comprises of many industries

//FOCUS ON:
medical device companies : generally have wide moats


1)BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES
Industry: Banking(still india has a scope for penetration)
cyclical - but behaves like hybrid of cyclical and defensive
Main business: Borrowing and lending
Other services: invoice discounting, insurance, MF sale, escrow accounts, 
Revenue model = net interest income(main business) + non-interest income (other services)
low cost of borrowing - bcoz they are regulated by RBI and backed by Govt
Balance sheet scrutiny is very important
A mortgage is usually a loan sanctioned against an immovable asset like a house or a commercial property. The lender keeps the 
 asset as collateral until the borrower repays the total loan amount. 
Banks losses must be covered by earnings , if not reserves , if losses > (earnings + reserves), they end up eating equity
Look for:
product/services portfolio depth and reach to public
Geograpical spread - good to have for risk management
loan diversification (to multiple sectors/industries/companies) - avoid banks where most loans are in riskier sectors
savings and other low cost deposits trend
Prudent recovery and collection procedures
low NPAs(for loans),charge-off rates(for credit cards) and delinquency rates(late payments) compared to peers
*delinquency rates are imp bcoz they can turn in to a NPA
*charge-off rate is a measure that shows the percentage of defaulted credit card balances in comparison to the total amount of credit outstanding
good provisioning wrt to NPAs
In this industry growth cannot be significantly faster than peers(if yes then it can lead to troubles , hence deep scrutiny is needed)
Must be Complient with Basel norms (for both liquidity and risk frameworks)
good banks make sure that the duration of long term liabilities is same as that of long term loans
Financials:
Should have strong Capital base compared to peers(check balance sheet)
operating costs and non-interest expense should less as a % of revenue
ROE and ROA must be high (provided provisions ~= GNPA )
CASA,NIM -Â must be more
higher CASA indicates current and saving account deposits are more compared to time deposits => low cost funds for banks =>high NIM
NPA - must be less
Good if Non interest income continously growing(extra income for bank) But this should complement interest income and not replace it
P/B between 2-3 is a good bet to buy strong banks
Moats:
Capital intensive business (difficult for new player to enter or the existing player to became No.1)
Brand(for attracting deposits and talent)
Size (Large banks have prudent risk management framework and access to Capital markets)
Economies of Scale(take advantage of larger distribution network)
Switching costs
Risk:
increase in NPAs during recession
not globally competetive 


Industry: Insurance (mostly avoid but if there is an exceptional company u can consider holding it)
revenue: 
1)recurring premiums and fees
2)invest the pooled assets and get the profit(kind of similar to banks)
expense:
1)insurance selling costs via agents/banks
2)benefits to shareholders
complex products and financial statements
It takes years for Insurance companies to know whether it made money on the policy or not - bcoz the life expectancy , 
future investment value and the time for which an individual will hold the policy is unknown
Also bcoz of the above reasons Insurance company cannot effectively price the policy
MOAT CHECK: weak moats in general
brand
distribution network
diverse products
established relationship with corporate consumers
consistent ROE and ROCE above 15%
annual premium growth rate not too high
credit rating
investment portfolio quality
low cost provider with volumes?
did it survive a disaster in the past(2008, 2021)
shouldn't sell unprofitable insurance policies
unique product: i.e providing insurance for those items which competetitiors don't provide
RISK:
extremely competetive - difficult to build a moat for longterm bcoz of commodity products which can be easily replaced
mostly a no MOAT business with thin margins, hence acquistions are needed for sustainace
big annuity business - risky investment as the exposure to equities is more
no pricing power : public always prefer low cost products, IRDAI regulates the premiums prices and puts a cap
some competetitiors price the policies so low and are ready to take losses in balance sheet to gain market share that will
eventually effect other firms profits. e.g LIC
cyclicality: even though it is a mature business since the profits are tied to market returns, in the bull market returns are good
and premiums are less but in during crash/bear markets premiums need to be increased to make profits but if competetitiors still keep 
it low then the firm suffers


Industry: Asset management
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4wC2k0zBEg&t=135s
revenue: % of recurring investments/SIPs
major expense : compensation of managers
keep an eye on operating expense
economies of scale: excellent (as it doesn't require more managers when the asset size to manage increases)
no capex, R&D and debt needed
loss is beared by customer unlike bank and isnurance business
MOAT check:
market share (smaller firms find it difficult to sustain the competetion)
more assets: total AUM YOY growth and absolute numbers compared to peers
companies with higher % of equity assets gain more
longterm solid track recored( required to attract investors)
diversification of products(investment in multiple asset classes)
diversification of investors
uniqueness of products if any like international investing, tax saving funds etc
stickiness of assets(money that stays in the firm even when times are tough)
AUM growth reason ? market prices/ net inflows are more
check for net inflows > net outflows in both bull and bear markets
CAMS(back office work) - only profitable if it deals with scale - need to spend on Technology
RISK:
extremely competetive industry - bcoz of high margins and economies of scale, lot of firms enter in to this business
people might stop SIPs and invest directly in stocks
new prodcut launches(like sector ETFs,international investing) from other firms can take away the prfoits - need to monitor
SEBI regulates MFs and they cannot invest in certain asset classes beyond a fixed %

Industry: capital markets : Depositories/Exchanges/Registrars etc


2)IT - defensive - globally competetive - high margins
highly competettive industry - low barriers to entry - high barriers to success
less capital required to build a software
like FMCG they generate a lot of cash
Generally have clean balance sheets with Zero debt
Excellent growth prospects bcoz businesses keep upgrading with latest software that can make business run smoothly and cut costs
services based: no significant cost
product based: R&D costs
Attractive segments: Security(antivirus, firewalls), IOT, AI, ML, BlockChain
LOOK FOR:
niche players like Adobe who has low competetion and strong Moats
Economies of Scale(once a software is developed revenue from new customer goes to bottom line)
company with Large customer base (that are Loyal to the company)
Great management(especially that don't give away ESPOs easily)
FINANCIALS:
License revenue(new softwares sold) trend should be increasing in general and also as a % of sales
Deffered revenue (cash recieved by the company even before service delivery) - indicated strong future revenues
if License revenues and Deffered revenues are declining then company's business has started to slow down
excellent track records in both the economy cycles (sales and profit margins)
MOATS:
narrow moat with most of the the firms
high switching costs (most of the customers train their employees and they can't spend again and again)
Network effect (certain products are used by large no of people)
Brand Name (people don't buy random software due to security issues)
RISK:
today's winner can be tomorrow's loser if the competetitior can develop a better product at a better price
don't invest blindly if u don't find a MOAT and not getting at a discount to intrinsic value(bcoz the pace at which technology is 
growing it is difficult to predict how software firms look like in the future)


3)HEALTHCARE - defensive
Industry : hospitals, Pharma, biotech, medical devices, diagnosis centers, Health insurance
globally competetive
R&D heavy
Drug development is costly, time consuming and no guarantee of success
take Big margin of safety for Pharma companies with certain drugs making up large % of sales
Drug companies whose products target wider audience or significant unmet needs - can make better margins
focus on medical devices industry as it has wide economic moats
Govt and regualatoty requirements can have deep impact on pricing power for the whole sector
Health Insurance is not an attractive business bcoz of the rising healthcare costs can wipe out profits
MOATS: 
Patent validity

4)FMCG - defensive - saviour in bear markets
business modal: company - retailers/wholsellers/distributors - customers
typically moves wrt to GDP and sometimes even slower than GDP - Hence they can ONLY be profitable in long term
Demand is almost static and hence profits are dependent on inflation
generally available at high valuations(bcoz of brand power and strong financials)
so while using DCF make sure cashflow rate is acc to gdp rate if not slightly higher
highly mature companies so very less growth strategies:(generally a mix of strategies is used)
-innovation:launch new products and capture market share (but new products has to click)
even when new prodcuts becomes popular still the revenue growth will be in single digit
R&D is important bcoz differentiated products boosts ur pricing power
-acquistion:acquire others business and grow(its better to acquire businesses in the same industry so that existing infrastructure can help )
also it depends on which company u have acquired and what price
-operating cost reduction
whatever the strategy you follow revenues can't grow above GDP, so company must focus on cost cutting like occasional restructuring
look for consistent low operating expenses and high OPM wrt peers
Note:cost cutting shouldn't happen in ads, bcoz brand may disappear from people's mind
-sell products overseas
there are countries which are in a growth spree and selling products in that area leads to double digit growth
e.g: cococola has a single digit growth in US but in abroad it has double digit growth
Economic Moats:
economies of scale(sell low cost product by spreading expenses on volumes)
brand recognition by customers + market share
strong distribution network(dedicated distributers even make it better)
Look out for:
*cash machines - check how company is utilising cash (look at dividend payout ratio, buybacks etc)
*are they building brand? - look at sales in comparison with ad spending, if the company is not spending on ads inspite of lesser sales
then the company might be focused on earnings and not on brand building (company should promote the brand but not products with low prices)
*innovation - is the company coming up with new flavor of exisiting product or completely innovative products
new flavor products is preferred by companies bcoz consumers are aware of the brand 
but for a completely innovative product to click it has to educate the customers, spend on ads and it has to have unique features and
substantial advantage over its substitutes(look out for companies that has launched new prodcuts successfully over the years)
*company has to cut costs but the growth shouldn't depend on cost cutting alone. It has to be accompained with sales growth 
bcoz cost cutting can happen to a certain extent after which it is difficult to cut costs
Risks:
inflation of raw materials
margins depend on middle class purchasing power
pricing power is questionable because middlemen like walmart and amazon have a huge customer attraction and can decide pricing


5)Energy
Industry: petrol
heavily relies on imports
no pricing power - price is globally decided

Industry :Gas

6)Power -Thermal/hydroelectric/renewable
capex heavy
huge fixed asset costs
low margins, high debt

7)Infra - cyclical

8)Telecom
heavily relies on imports - atmnirbhar bharat and PLI schemes can be game changers
capex heavy
financial strength needed to continously improve network (hence generally have high debt)
high fixed cost business (i.e during low demand where revenues can't suffice u need to pay from reserves or even take debt)
highly competetive industry (i.e firms compete on price hence margins are thin)
highly regulated industry (firms need to be flexible enough)

9)Agriculture

10)commodities sector
no pricing power
cyclical - high volatility
MOATS: low cost provider(high volumes)

11)Automobile
R&D heavy

12)chemical

13)Consumer services
highly competetive sector - no pricing power hence thin margins
low or no barriers to entry
outperform during periods of economic strength and underperform during econoimic weakness
industries: Restaurants(QSR,FSR), retailers(like walmart,Dmart, clothing companies)
with both parents working QSR is increasingly becoming popular
look for companies that provide quality, quick and low cost services
Retailers with CCC -ve , i.e with less inventory and more payable days are bound to be strong
recievable days are negligible for retailers as they collect cash from customers immediately
speciality retaiers like Nike, Puma ,Decatholon have MOATS for short term
only Moat: low cost supplier(economies of scale)
Risk:
changing consumer trends and firms need to match up to that
most consumer services concepts fail in the long run, so if u made investment in a speculative growth stage of a company
 then u need to continously monitor
financials might be inflated bcoz lease amount is not recorded on the balance sheet


14)Business services: 
we can find excellent businesses with wide moats
Generally companies outsource their non-core tasks to third parties to save time and money.
these taks are the core business of business services companies
i)tech based: data processing(cloud services),database providers, registry sevices, card payment network
there is competetion but growth opputunities are so high that all the competetitiors/peers enjoy a decent growth
hence in such scenarios frims don't compete on price rather they focus on capex/expansion
low capital requirements(no advertising,capex,R&D and warehouse costs)
hence look for companies with higher operating leverage, high free cash flow
high entry barriers (look for companies with large scale operations)
generally operate on long-term contracts(look for stable financial performance)
look for companies which provide a wide range of services (companies want to consolidate their purchases and maintain relations with few firms)
ii)people based: advertising, consulting and professional services(rating agencies,TCS,Accenture), staffing
money made = money billed from client  - salary paid - other costs
need to hire best talent and pay more salaries else they might lose clients(hence look for companies that hires freshers 
regulary and trains them to reduce the overall cost by paying them low salaries)
But when economy goes down these type of companies lose clients and their profits take a hit
Generally have narrow moats and highly competetive industry(so look for companies with strong client relationship)
Also look for brands that provide differentiated services at low cost - they tend to have wide MOATS
iii)hard assets based: waste management, airlines, logistics
airlines - better to avoid bcoz of their huge fixed costs and still they sell a commodity service
heavily rely on incremental fixed costs to grow their business(hence more debt in balance sheet)
Having debt is justified if the company can earn the cost of capital(to service both equity and debt) using its assets
check fixed assets turnover ratio for this Fixed-asset turnover is the ratio of sales to the value of fixed assets. 
It indicates how well the business is using its fixed assets to generate sales.
MOATS:
brand
size
barrier to entry
Trust by large companies
Note: preference - tech based > people based > hard asset based
Look at the earnings growth rate expectations from PEG ration if it is unrealestic then wait for correction at realistic growth rate
if not u can avoid the stock

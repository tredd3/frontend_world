******* value vs growth investing ********
value investing - buying best companies at fair/undervalued prices so that value you get is 
more than the price you pay for the company.
misconception: people buy bluechip companies at random prices and call it value investing
Growth investor - invests in companies which might click and turn in to a great business fetching great returns. 
 But if it collapses u will loose ur capital
Value investor - might not get great returns but will never loose capital even in tough times.


***** company liquidation ******

*******GOOD dividend paying companies ******
Companies which not only pay good dividend but also their dividend payment increases every yr
* Net profit/income increasing for last 5 yrs?
*  Check if the EPS has grown in last 5 years.
* Also check if DPS - dividend per share has grown in last 5 years.
* Compare if EPS growth and dividend per share growth are similar.
* Dividend yield can sometimes be misleading, i.e if share price decreases dividend yield seems to be high
* Dividend payout should also be more
Moral of the story: It is important to look at dividend yield, but in conjunction with other fundamentals like sales, profit, EPS, dividend payout %, etc.
Also reinvest the dividend in other dividend paying stocks

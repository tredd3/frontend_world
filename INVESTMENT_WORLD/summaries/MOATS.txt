How to identify Great businesses? 
Every company is like an empire which has economic moats.
Economic MOATS - strengths that are not easy to break by competitors / market trends/ public choice or decision/Govt intervention


//All possible MOATs
1)low cost production:
value of the product should be less compared to overall expenditure of a person/family then only customer pays premium because 
 the product cost is less compared to their salary/spending
made for a penny, sold for a dollar and customer loyalty is high(customer keeps coming)
New companies cannot break this moat bcoz they will be in loss
2)Brand - there should be trust in the public
Breakable? -takes many years to build
Real product differentiation - i.e products are more popular => but constant innovation is needed and lot of cash is sucked up
Percieved product differentiation - Brand name itself is enough people are ready to pay premium
3)distribution network -  should have wide geographical presence - so that it can cater to wide audience across the country/globe
4)R&D negligible- bcoz if more is spent on R&D and people donâ€™t like the products or if any competitor comes up with more exciting products money spent on R&D gets wasted.
Instead this money could have reinvested and compounding effect is achieved
5)Taste - making people habituated with taste
Examples: cococola, Britannia, oreo, amul icecream and most of the FMCG or F&B businesses
for competitors to break this or overcome this hurdle is nearly impossible.
Hence they start negative publicity
6)high entry bariers like high capex, highly skill needed, complex operations ,heavy machinery operations,
 not easy to start/replace/maintain, high govt regulations
7)switching cost
8)Luxury/Premium range: People are ready to pay premium because the value addition is huge compared to the price - mostly rich 
 people and businesses focus on it (like apple, Luxury furniture, Experiences etc)

How to identify Great businesses? 
Every company is like an empire which has economic moats.
Check if economic MOATS can be broken
Economic MOATS - strengths that are not easy to break by competitors / market trends/ public choice or decision
GRADE A MOATS: 
1)low cost production - value of the product should be less compared to overall expenditure of a person/family then only there will customer loyalty
Breakable? - new companies cannot break this moat bcoz they will be in loss
2)Brand - there should be trust in the public
Breakable? -takes many years to build
3)distribution network -  should have wide geographical presence - so that it can cater to wide audience across the country/globe
4)R&D negligible- bcoz if more is spent on R&D and people don’t like the products or if any competitor comes up with more exciting products money spent on R&D gets wasted.
Instead this money could have reinvested and compounding effect is achieved
5)Taste - making people habituated with taste
Examples: cococola, Britannia, oreo, amul icecream and most of the FMCG or F&B businesses
for competitors to break this or overcome this hurdle is nearly impossible.
Hence they start negative publicity
GRADE B MOATS: All Grade A moats - taste moat 
GRADE C MOATS: high entry bariers like high capex, highly skill needed, complex operations ,heavy machinery operations,
 not easy to start, high govt regulations - hence new players find it difficult to enter and sustain


Good businesses : 
1)Companies whose moats are difficult to breakGrade A companies - made for a penny, sold for a dollar and customer loyalty is high 
i.e the customer keeps coming and is ready to pay premium as the cost is negligible compared to their overall expenses
E.g: B2C companies like FMCG - cigarette, chewing gums, cold drinks, ice-cream, beverages, biscuits, chocolate, Maggie etc
Grade B companies :
E.g: detergents like Ariel, prestige, toothpaste, hair oils like parachute, Gillette (p&g), Johnson and Johnson, Johnson baby, fevicol, Asian paints, page industries(jockey under garments)
Grade C companies :E.g: Reliance, L&T,  MTAR, HAL, Airtel, ONGC, Adani ports,SAIL, BHEL, DRDO, GAIL

3)People are ready to pay premium because the product cost is less compared to their salary/spending

Bad businesses: those which don't have pricing power1)Airlines - people are not ready to pay premium2)B2B: 
B2B business is a bad investment bcoz B2C companies might cut them off if they increase the price.
Hence in terms of profits B2B business will have relatively lesser profitsException: L&T, Intel bcoz they established a sense of trust/brand/customer loyalty
3)E-commerce - people search for discounted prices and won’t pay premium
Mostly they are loss making businesses as they burn cash to capture mark
4)A BIG NO TO:
BPOs - replaced by MI,AL
Auto - EVs are the future, also they spend more on R&D, highly competitive market
Chinese companies - chances of getting banned

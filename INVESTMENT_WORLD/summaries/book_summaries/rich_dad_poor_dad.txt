Rich dad poor dad advices:
Never stop learning, listening and understanding the bigger picture
In Today’s world what u know doesn’t matter much bcoz it might be old but how fast u can learn
 Is a price less skill u need to acquire
Considering knowledge unimportant is Arrogance - and people lose money because of arrogance
Guilt is worse than greed. Little bit of greed is fine bcoz it is the best cure for laziness, but too much of 
anything  is dangerous which applies for greed as well
We can’t afford it versus how can I afford it - will open ur mind to think and grab opportunities
Instead of living a life by controlling ur expenses and spending as less as possible, think in a different way
And see how can I live a rich life and still get my expenses covered (i.e how can I build my  asset column in a  
  way that they give me enough cashflow to cover expenses)
Money is an illusion - real asset is ur brain, whose power can be harnessed to create money and 
  make it work for you by acquire investing skills even before u get into investment itself
Never be afraid/fear that you will lose money, there is no person who has become rich not by loosing money,
  On the other hand the poor never lost a rupee
Learn how to manage risk, learn from mistakes, become stronger and smarter - NEVER FEAR THAT YOU WILL LOSE - either you win or you learn
Poor people critisize(why stock market, why real estate you will lose money there, why debt why credit card)
Rich people Analyse (if you lose money that’s ok, more important is to find out y u lost money and never repeating this mistake in ur life again) - good debt is always good as it can help u create wealth but in limits,
Same goes with credit card if u can utilise it properly and take it to ur advantage
Great oppurtunities are not seen with your eyes rather they are seen with ur mind
Knowledge + courage combo  can make u financially independent
Know about various Cash generating assets - make money work for you
Form private Corporations/trust and learn about their tax rules 
Real estate loop hole for evading tax by trading real estate over short period of time - read on that
Acquire properties in bank auctions or from insolvency court
Right amount of financial knowledge helps u in distinguishing bad and good investment quickly
Don’t Avoid risk learn how to manage it - using knowledge, wisdom , learning etc
Learn less and less about more and more - be a generalist who touches upon all the topics, get a bigger picture and not a  Specialist who only know his stuff and nothing else
Work to Learn and don’t work only for money
Communication skills are extremely important 
Acquiring Sales and  marketing skills is priceless  - do some online courses/listen to best youtubers
Giving money to charities/foundations is the secret of many wealthy families -  ore you give more you receive
School only teaches you how to be employees and not employers - school doesn’t teach anything about money , hence parents need to do that

3 management skills we need to have:
Time management
Cashflow management
People management

4 pillars of financial intelligence:
1)learn accountancy
2)learn investing principles/strategies
3)Understand how financial instruments and markets(stock/real-estate/bond/gold markets) work 
4)find loop holes of taxing system - explore how to escape taxes legally


Workflow  of riches: 
Technique 1: 
1)Put stable assets like real estate and FD in ur assets column
2)stable assets generate slow and steady income 
3)reinvest that income in stock markets (small and midcap) 
4)gains/income generated in stock markets => move that to stable assets
Repeat step 3 and compound ur wealth 

Technique 2:
1)invent money - by understanding tax loop holes like in real estate
2)buy assets with the invented money
3)assets generate income for the CORPORATION not individual
4)income - expenses, remaining amount is taxed
5)After tax is deducted put the remaining amount back in assets
Repeat step 3 - over the years ur wealth will be compounded


Note: once the income from ur asset column is much higher than the expenses, that is the time to get in to 
Some speculative/risky investments based on ur knowledge

Poor cashflow:
Job -> Income -> expenses
Middle class cashflow:
Job -> Income -> liabilities -> expenses
Rich cashflow:
Building ur assets column requires knowledge, patience, guts and on top everything the mindset to manage risk
Assets -> Income -> expenses -> remaining reinvested in assets (cyclical process)

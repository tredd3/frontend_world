//set of companies that can be a good buy
Lynch says he would prefer simple business model + average management + no competettion (easy to follow and if any random person 
 can run this business means the business in itself has a MOAT and it doesn't depend on person to run it )
Over complex industry + high competettion + good management

------ Companies that can have wider MOAT and are highly profitable in the long run --------

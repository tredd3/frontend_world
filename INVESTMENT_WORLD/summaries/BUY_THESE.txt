//set of companies that can be a good buy
Lynch says he would prefer simple business model + average management + no competettion (easy to follow and if any fool 
 can run this business means the business in itself has a MOAT and it doesn't depend on person to run it )
Over complex industry + high competettion + good management


****** LESS RISK Companies ********
1.Monopolies - look at market share and market size , also sector growth
2.all weather companies/defensive stocks - earnings are consistent in all kinds of economic situations
3.globally competitive - diversified revenue/customer base/global expansion oppurtunities
4.consumer recognised brands like FMCG companies - pricing power and continuous demand
5.companies producing daily use essential goods/services used by public :
babies: Johnson & Johnson products
Kids: biscuits(Britannia, hide and seek, Oreo), Choclates(nestle),fast food
Women: makeup , beauty and personal products, gold and jewellery (Nykaa, Titan)

Family: agriculture, insurance, pharma, food, beverages, FMCG like ITC, HUL, power (coal, solar), clothing (inners like Rupa, jockey)


*******GOOD dividend paying companies ******
Companies which not only pay good dividend but also their dividend payment increases every yr
* Net profit/income increasing for last 5 yrs?
*  Check if the EPS has grown in last 5 years.
* Also check if DPS - dividend per share has grown in last 5 years.
* Compare if EPS growth and dividend per share growth are similar.
* Dividend yield can sometimes be misleading, i.e if share price decreases dividend yield seems to be high
* Dividend payout should also be more
Moral of the story: It is important to look at dividend yield, but in conjunction with other fundamentals like sales, profit, EPS, dividend payout %, etc.
Also reinvest the dividend in other dividend paying stocks


------ Companies that can have wider MOAT and are highly profitable in the long run --------
Golden rule: prefer asset lite business model

AMC (MOAT: Economies of scale, Switching cost)
Business services - tech based/people based
media/Entertainment
Healthcare
Basket of IT/Software companies
deals with very sensitive sectors needing lot of approvals and gain client trust/confidence - high entry barriers
niche/extreme niche - does something very specific which takes a lot of time to build (MOAT: entry barriers, switching cost)
New age businesses that has a capacity to suffer - i.e they are diverting profits to build long term moats 
  Noet: always buy them only when they are profitable for like 2 yrs in a row, bcoz of most of them might not be profitable and you
  will lose money
Lousy industries: No growth Industry where the company is growing by acquiring market share and becomes profitable
  It does something dull and less profitable(manufacturing bottle caps, plastic forks) - demand throughout the year but no new 
  competettion wants to enter this business (MOAT: entry barriers, switching cost)
  It does something disagreeable and profitable(waste management, cleaning, chappals, underwear) - demand throughout the year but 
  no new competettion wants to do this because of the nature of the business (MOAT: entry barriers, switching cost)
  high capex is needed no one wants to enter or it is difficult to build such infra in less time (GAIL, powergrid, IOCL)
repeat business - people need to keep buying it to survive/daily needs (MOAT: low cost producer, Brand, distribution network)
Platform/Infrastucture Business(Indiamart, IEX, Amazon, Zomato) - (MOAT: Economies of scale, Switching cost, Distribution network)

//set of companies that can be a good buy
Lynch says he would prefer simple business model + average management + no competettion (easy to follow and if any fool 
 can run this business means the business in itself has a MOAT and it doesn't depend on person to run it )
Over complex industry + high competettion + good management


****** LESS RISK Companies ********
1.Monopolies - look at market share and market size , also sector growth
2.all weather companies/defensive stocks - earnings are consistent in all kinds of economic situations
3.globally competitive - diversified revenue/customer base/global expansion oppurtunities
4.consumer recognised brands like FMCG companies - pricing power and continuous demand
5.companies producing daily use essential goods/services used by public :
babies: Johnson & Johnson products
Kids: biscuits(Britannia, hide and seek, Oreo), Choclates(nestle),fast food
Women: makeup , beauty and personal products, gold and jewellery
Adults: investment, banking,  finance, automobile (parts manufacturing, tires, petrol, engine oils, batteries), electronics(parts manufacturing) fitness and health (zydus wellness), tea/coffee, IT, telecom, habbits (entertainment, booze, cigars) , tourism
Family: agriculture, insurance, pharma, food, beverages, FMCG like ITC, HUL, power (coal, solar), clothing (inners like Rupa, jockey)


*******GOOD dividend paying companies ******
Companies which not only pay good dividend but also their dividend payment increases every yr
* Net profit/income increasing for last 5 yrs?
*  Check if the EPS has grown in last 5 years.
* Also check if DPS - dividend per share has grown in last 5 years.
* Compare if EPS growth and dividend per share growth are similar.
* Dividend yield can sometimes be misleading, i.e if share price decreases dividend yield seems to be high
* Dividend payout should also be more
Moral of the story: It is important to look at dividend yield, but in conjunction with other fundamentals like sales, profit, EPS, dividend payout %, etc.
Also reinvest the dividend in other dividend paying stocks

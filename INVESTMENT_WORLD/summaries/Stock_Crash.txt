//what to do when stock price is falling:
Golden fact: 
Sometimes fundamentals and stock price move in opposite direction for short term.
so if fundamentals are good and stock price is down (it could be a potential buy based on valuations)


//why is the stock falling? 
US yr end tax selling: nov - dec
Indian yr end tax selling: feb - march
1)when large number of people are selling it they must know some information
   what is that information? google it or exchange fillings
2)once u know the reason are you ok to hold it? 
   is it a short term phenomenon/long term hit?
3)why did you buy the stock? - go through the story
   did the story/fundamentals change? if it significantly changed/impacted then you can sell
4)do you really believe in the stock and have the courage to hold if stock falls further?
i.e can you put 25% of your net worth and forget about it for next 10 yrs in a stock?

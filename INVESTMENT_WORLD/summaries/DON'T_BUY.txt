** Similarities in Worst companies :
1.Promoter shareholding keeps decreasing
2.Promoter pledging increases over the years
3.Debt/Equity is huge and have increased over the years
4.Mindless diversification - entering into businesses in which they don't have expertise
5.not adapting to change - like ev vehicles for auto sector, 5G tech for telecom, latest innovations in electronics latest innovations in electronics
6.costly acquisitions


** companies to AVOID
/CONTINOUSLY needs to do capex to stay in business like infra comapnies (telecom, energy, airlines, utilities)
  However you can buy companies providing services to above sectors as those comapnies will be at the receiving end and the
  above sectors will be at the spending end.
  e.g: NBCC (infra and construction services)
  Sterlite technologies(telecom optical fibre setup and monitoring services)
/CONTINOUSLY needs to spend more money on R&D to stay in business like electronics, auto and pharma companies that spend heavily on R&D
 However if you find an exceptional company(strong MOAT) which is both efficient and profitable in above sectors then buy
/companies that have huge debt or need to take debt CONTINOUSLY to survive 
during Bull run: it will eat away profits => EPS decreases => share price decreases
during Bear crash: it can make company bankrupt
and also company has to pay interest even if it is in loss => assets needs to be sold => bankruptcy
/Avoid industries that are highly competetive and no compnay has a DCA like auto, telecom, aviation industries - as 
    no company can make huge profits due to zero pricing power
/Avoid commodity stocks like metals (unless u know the commodity cycle and track its prices and supply etc) because price is decided
  globally and it can take you around 80-90% down if you enter at he wrong time.
/hotest trending stocks - can be locked at very expensive valuation
  Avoid hottest stock in the hottest industry like Tata Motors
  problem with the tech/hottest industry: it attracts smart people and someone in the world will always try and get the technology 
  products at cheaper price hence instead of focusing on tech stocks focus on companies that use this tech and become EFFICIENT. 
  Now tomorrow when the R&D people succeed and come with a low cost product, then the company that is already using the tech will be
  more PROFITABLE (infact EFFICIENT + PROFITABLE)
/stocks with buzz of next IBM, next Microsoft, next HUL etc
/serial Acquirers like Zydus but if it is for strategic purpose(related businesses) then fine else acquiring companies to become a conglomerate is bad.
   However if the price at which the companies are acquired is low and the performance of the acquired companies(subsidaries) 
   is great then we can consider holding the company like (infoedge and bekshire has acquired companies that doesn't provide any 
   strategic role , they acuired it for investment purposes and they are doing great as an investment so that is fine)
/over diversification - enetering in to businesses or acquiring businesses that doesn't belong to the expertise level of the current 
  compnay it is bound to see losses.
  However if the company does the reverse and sell all the unrelated businesses then it will be a turnaround oppurtunity
/having very few clients like railtel
/irregular growth  or too high growth in small span (50%/100% growth rate in 1-2 years) - this is unsustainable
/No new development of products or not catching up with current trends
/commodity type business where price power doesn't lie with the company
/B2B companies(suppliers) that doesn't have pricing power because of high competettion/high customer and revenue concentration

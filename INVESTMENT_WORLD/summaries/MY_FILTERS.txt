//overall requirements to be satisfied by a company
BUSINESS + FINANCIAL +  Management + VALUATION (all are equally important) + Margin of safety(for growth companies,
fair price for Value companies)

//FIRST set of companies - getting them on fair valuation is also fine
CRISIL Rating must be Above A
Note: increase margin of safety for companies which doesn't pass important filters
1)why did the promoters start business (family legacy/passion/strategic importance to other companies) - PASSION clearly wins
2)check the share price in wiki (continously decreasing know the reason why)
3)check shareholding pattern
4)can company's business/products/services be replaced/substituted by new age technology/innovative products/services?
5)avoid companies with intense competettion (The intense competition could restrict company's revenue growth and it
 takes away its pricing power)
6)monopoly or duopoly
7)repeat business

//overall requirements to be satisfied by a company
BUSINESS + FINANCIAL +  Management + VALUATION (all are equally important) + Margin of safety(for growth companies,
fair price for Value companies)

//FIRST set of companies - getting them on fair valuation is also fine
CRISIL Rating must be Above A
Note: increase margin of safety for companies which doesn't pass important filters
1)why did the promoters start business (family legacy/passion/strategic importance to other companies) - PASSION clearly wins
2)check the share price in wiki (continously decreasing know the reason why)
3)check shareholding pattern and trend over the years in tijori
4)can company's business/products/services be replaced/substituted by new age technology/innovative products/services?
5)avoid companies with intense competettion (The intense competition could restrict company's revenue growth and it
 takes away its pricing power)
6)monopoly or duopoly
7)repeat business
6)owns customer minds? 
7)what is the competettive advantage/MOAT and does the company have one compared to its competetiors?
  if yes is it durable?
  if NO what is the 10 yr picture u have in ur mind? will it build one?
8)entry barriers - bcoz the businesses are difficult to start/replace/maintain
  check market share trend over the years
9)geographical diversification - globally present? if not does it have a deep rural reach?
 better to have both, which helps in risk Management and strong growth oppurtunities in emerging countries
 for a company with high global presence , global competettion, political and currency risk need to be monitored
10)product diversification
11)if B2B (client diversification, strong order book)
if B2C (products must be useful for each and every individual and have a strong demand)
if business service companies (almost every business should find its usage now or eventually)
12)non commoditized business, if commoditized then must be a low cost producer
13)non cyclical or least cyclical
cyclical + high fixed cost => DANGER as debt levels will be high, e.g: Airlines
14)pricing power - are people ready to pay premium (can the compnay increase the product prices in the cases like inflation and
  be sure that people still buy their products?)
 This will happen only when they add value to the customers in terms of 
   i)quality of product/service OR
   ii)affordable price OR any other thing which their competetiors cannot give
15)not dependent on/tightly linked to fortunes of a single client company/certain companies
16)not dependent on govt lifting bans on imports, govt subsidies/schemes or order inflows only from 
  govt or limited clients or will get orders only on low bidding(here others can take over or it will
  put pressure on margins)
17)strong financials for 10yrs - especially check their 5/10yr cash flow analysis in tijori and initial summary section in screener
18)debt free or almost debt free
19)should not require contionus investment on capex OR significant investment in R&D (for eg some pharma companies put >40% of
  revenues in R&D, if it succeeds then new revenue stream but if it fails then stock price will crash)
e.g: Telecom companies need to continously upgrade their network equipments and infra
20)High growth potential - both vertically (nation wide including rural areas) and horizontally (internationally)
   avoid companies with limited market size - as the companies doesn't have an option to expand beyond a certain point
   e.g some companies market is limited to only domestic and that too only few businesses/clients need it
21)Avoid companies that has grown only because of Acquisitions(like Zydus, Workday etc) because of the below reasons:
  i) company will not have that USP built in , it will not have any core philosophy and hence might not attract investors. 
  ii)Also the cost at which it is acquiring companies is very important. what if all the acquired companies work culture is 
    different ? there will not be any synergy 
  iii)rather it will be very complex for the management to handle putting the companies revenues and growth for a toss.
  iv)management will not have a mindset to fix the business model, rather always think of few more acquisitions to solve the
    all the problems mentioned.


//SECOND set of companies - high margin of safety
sleeping gaints awakened (turnaround like IDFC First, VI)
value unlocking(highly profitable companies getting demerged from conglomerates
  e.g: ITC Infotech, ITC FMCG demerger from ITC group
ignored companies that have very strong growth potential in the future
emerging tech companies
companies in emerging industries
companies acquiring market share from organised peers or unorganised peers
deals with very sensitive sectors needing lot of approvals and gain client trust/confidence
niche/extreme niche

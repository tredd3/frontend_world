***** GOLDEN RULES *********
Success Criteria = Long term vision + Courage + Patience + Discipline(in investing,learning,knowledge upgradation)

INVEST IN YOURSELF: Read and analyse News - link it with ur investment , Books, finance Videos

CONROL UR EMOTIONS - intrinsic value changes anually, market value changes every minute (make volatility your friend )

LEARN FROM OTHERS MISTAKES - read more and apply them

DON'T TIME THE MARKET - You only need to react.
e.g: if the market falls buy stocks, if it raises bcoz of high PE and no earnings backup then sell

NEVER LOSE CAPITAL

Cash is not good investment - inflation will reduce its worth Invest in productive assets

Compounding is the 8th wonder - time is the key, make the most of it by investing early

when everyone is greedy be fearful and when everyone is fearful be greedy

THERE IS A DIFF between good company and good investment.
excellent company at expensive valuation is still a bad investment
Note: Great product might not make the company great and great company can not be a great investment at high valuations

RISK LIES IN THE PRICE AND NOT ASSET CLASS - buy assets at cheaper price
Even Buying great companies at higher valuation is also a poor investment
always have margin of safety so that you have cushion incase your predictions went wrong or future screws up

MARGIN OF SAFETY: depends on the company
excellent and predictable businesses margin of safety can be less
for unpredictable businesses margin of safety should be more
Note: sometimes it takes years for a stock to be available at a fair price/undervaluation. Patience is the key 

HAVE KNOWLEDGE BEFORE INVESTING - MORE KNOWLEDGE === LESS RISK
Stay in your circle of competence - invest in industries which you understand or believe

Short term - PE is significant(speculator focus), long term - earnings are significant(investor focus)
SO, LONG TERM INVESTOR SHOULD HAVE A OWNER MINDSET: focus on business not on share price, bcoz if earnings increase market sentiment(P/E) increases and hence share price eventually increases)
Long term stock increases

Categories of Stock: 
1)slow growers(HUL,Dabur) - highly mature, revenue growth 1-5% inline with GDP growth or even lesser
2)stalwarts - 10-15% revenue growth (TataElixi, IEX)
3)Fast Growers (Praj)
4)cyclicals(Auto industry, Travel)
5)Asset heavy(most of the PSUs)
6)Turnarounds(Tata consumer products, NBCC,IDFC First bank) - raising from RIP to star 


WHEN TO BUY: 
Index: when both PE and Earnings are less, market_cap/GDP < 1
Stocks: buy Great business at fair price instead of buying fair business at a wonderful price
Seize the opportunity and play big if you get wonderful businesses at great price/undervalued price
Always Invest in tranches bcoz we don't know if the market is gona fall further and we need to have capital to invest more
Note: when a solid company delivers poor results, news about economy/sector degrowth can be buy oppurtunities for long term investors

WHEN TO SELL: idea is to hold it forever to get compounding benefit, but in below scenarios we can think of selling securities
Index: when both PE and Earnings are exceptionally high
Stocks: 
Don't sell just because someone told you to do so(do you believe in what they said? did they speak facts/logical guesses or is it a 
 random guess with pure speculation)
Don't sell because the stock crashed by 30%(rather buy more if the fundamentals are strong and story/reason y u bought hasn't changed)
Don't sell because the stock has doubled/tripled (if the stock has strong fundamentals like strong earning growth rate, excellent 
 financials then probably it will become a ten bagger - then y to settle 2 or 3 bagger)
If fundamentals gone bad or the company might be losing its DCA then u need to sell to protect capital even though u might face minor loss
2)if fundamentals are good but stock is trading at much higher price than intrinsic value, in such a way that it takes a decade
or more for a company's earnings to match the stock price (i.e price is very high compared to their growth rate)
so we can sell it and put the money in liquid funds and wait for another bear market
3)Rare Thing: if you find other excellent investments at attractive price
Note: Moreover if you sell u need to pay tax apart from losing a great business
4)if your initial analysis is wrong like u over estimated company growth and under estimated competettion
5)products not in demand and company focusing on launching new products rather than improving existing ones
6)for fast growers like Zomato when key employees resign

//when to sell slow growers
company lost market share
no new products being developed/no R&D spend
acquiring unrelated businesses in the name of diversification
leveraged buyout(acquisition)/paying more for an acquisisition(much greater than intrinsic value) reducing the cash

//when to sell stalwarts
divison contributing highest to revenues is undergoing economic downturn(cigarettes for ITC)
growth rate has become slow and company don't doesn't have any plans to revive growth

//when to sell cyclicals
why did you buy this cyclical? if you have some reason then it is still valid? if NO sell
for example reasons to buy: demand is strong / commodity prices are very low and will increase sooner/no competettior
domestic products to be replaced by low cost imports

//when to sell fast growers
company has already grown so much that it has no room for growth
top executives leaving the company

//when to sell turn arounds
if the company has turned around and public have confidence to buy - now the company probably has already become a multi-bagger
 it might grow some 40-50% but not 5X or 10X.
debt is increasing year on year
inventories rising at twice than sales


//when to sell asset plays
As long as the company is not taking debt that reduces the overall asset value you can hold(you might need very patience)

NEVER LOSE CAPITAL

THERE IS A DIFF between good company and good investment.
excellent company at expensive valuation is still a bad investment
Note: Great product might not make the company great and great company can not be a great investment at high valuations

RISK LIES IN THE PRICE AND NOT ASSET CLASS - buy assets at cheaper price
Even Buying great companies at higher valuation is also a poor investment
always have margin of safety so that you have cushion incase your predictions went wrong or future screws up

MARGIN OF SAFETY: depends on the company
excellent and predictable businesses margin of safety can be less
for unpredictable businesses margin of safety should be more
Note: sometimes it takes years for a stock to be available at a fair price/undervaluation. Patience is the key 

HAVE KNOWLEDGE BEFORE INVESTING - MORE KNOWLEDGE === LESS RISK
Stay in your circle of competence - invest in industries which you understand or believe

Short term - PE is significant(speculator focus), long term - earnings are significant(investor focus)
SO, LONG TERM INVESTOR SHOULD HAVE A OWNER MINDSET: focus on business not on share price, bcoz if earnings increase market sentiment(P/E) increases and hence share price eventually increases)

WHEN TO BUY: 
Index: when both PE and Earnings are less, market_cap/GDP < 1
Stocks: buy Great business at fair price instead of buying fair business at a wonderful price
Seize the opportunity and play big if you get wonderful businesses at great price/undervalued price
Always Invest in tranches bcoz we don't know if the market is gona fall further and we need to have capital to invest more

WHEN TO SELL: idea is to hold it forever to get compounding benefit, but in below scenarios we can think of selling securities
Index: when both PE and Earnings are exceptionally high
Stocks: 
1)If fundamentals gone bad or the company might be losing its DCA then u need to sell to protect capital even though u might face minor loss
2)if fundamentals are good but stock is trading at much higher price than intrinsic value, in such a way that the returns we get
by holding the stock for longterm is equivalent to selling the stock.
so we can sell it and put the money in liquid funds and wait for another bear market
3)Rare Thing: if you find other excellent investments at attractive price
Note: Moreover if you sell u need to pay tax apart from losing a great business
4)if your initial analysis is wrong like u over estimated company growth and under estimated competettion

***** GOLDEN RULES *********
Risks in Stock Market/Investing
1)Loss of Capital
2)Not getting Adequate returns

Success Criteria = Long term vision + Courage + Patience + Discipline(in investing,learning,knowledge upgradation)
How much Patience? - few stocks take 5-10yrs to become multi baggers (keep udating the story and track the earnings unless they both
 are good your patience will be rewarded with a multi bagger)

INVEST IN YOURSELF: Read and analyse News - link it with ur investment , Books, finance Videos

CONTROL UR EMOTIONS - intrinsic value changes anually, market value changes every second (make volatility your friend )
you might have done deep research on the stock , but don't be emotionally attached as only logic wins in the stock market
if you can't control emotions you can't control your money

LEARN FROM OTHERS MISTAKES - read more and apply them

DON'T TIME THE MARKET - You only need to react.
e.g: if the market falls buy stocks, if it raises bcoz of high PE and no earnings backup then sell

Cash is not good investment - inflation will reduce its worth Invest in productive assets

Compounding is the 8th wonder - time is the key, make the most of it by investing early

when everyone is greedy be fearful and when everyone is fearful be greedy

THERE IS A DIFF between good company and good investment.
excellent company at expensive valuation is still a bad investment
Note: Great product might not make the company great and great company can not be a great investment at high valuations

RISK LIES IN THE PRICE AND NOT ASSET CLASS - buy assets at cheaper price
Even Buying great companies at higher valuation is also a poor investment
always have margin of safety so that you have cushion incase your predictions went wrong or future screws up

MARGIN OF SAFETY: depends on the company
excellent and predictable businesses margin of safety can be less
for unpredictable businesses margin of safety should be more
Note: sometimes it takes years for a stock to be available at a fair price/undervaluation. Patience is the key 

HAVE KNOWLEDGE BEFORE INVESTING - MORE KNOWLEDGE === LESS RISK
Stay in your circle of competence - invest in industries which you understand or believe

Instead of watching the stocks go up and down on your screen, devote ur time analysing stocks, read news/reports etc

Short term - PE is significant(speculator focus), long term - earnings are significant(investor focus)
SO, LONG TERM INVESTOR SHOULD HAVE A OWNER MINDSET: focus on business not on share price, bcoz if earnings increase market sentiment(P/E) increases and hence share price eventually increases)
Long term stock increases

Categories of Stock: 
1)slow growers(HUL,Dabur) - highly mature, revenue growth 1-5% inline with GDP growth or even lesser
2)stalwarts - 10-15% revenue growth (TataElixi, IEX)
3)Fast Growers (Praj)
4)cyclicals(Auto industry, Travel)
5)Asset heavy(most of the PSUs)
6)Turnarounds(Tata consumer products, NBCC,IDFC First bank) - raising from RIP to star 

** Behaviours to avoid
Loss aversion bias - having fear of loosing money
Sunk cost fallacy - investing more and more in the companies that are continuously falling without knowing the reason
Herd behaviour - whatever large no.of people do is true
Social proofing -  blindly investing if big people invest without knowing the price at which they invested
Recency bias - investing in companies/MFs that has performed recently well without looking at fundamentals, 
Investing in all IPOs
Outcome bias - investing based only on the results and not on the process
Overconfidence bias - investing more and more when u gain significant gains without any logic in investing


WHEN TO BUY: 
Index: when both PE and Earnings are less, market_cap/GDP < 1
Stocks: buy Great business at fair price instead of buying fair business at a wonderful price
Seize the opportunity and play big if you get wonderful businesses at great price/undervalued price
Always Invest in tranches bcoz we don't know if the market is gona fall further and we need to have capital to invest more
Note: when a solid company delivers poor results, news about economy/sector degrowth can be buy oppurtunities for long term investors

***** GOLDEN RULES *********
INVEST IN YOURSELF: Read and analyse News - link it with ur investment , Books, finance Videos
CONROL UR EMOTIONS - intrinsic value changes anually, market value changes every minute (make volatility your friend )
LEARN FROM OTHERS MISTAKES - read more and apply them
1)NEVER LOSE CAPITAL
2)RISK LIES IN THE PRICE AND NOT ASSET CLASS - buy assets at cheaper price
Even Buying great companies at higher valuation is also a risky thing 
3)HAVE KNOWLEDGE BEFORE INVESTING - MORE KNOWLEDGE === LESS RISK
Stay in your circle of competence - invest in industries which you understand or believe
4)Short term - PE is significant(speculator focus), long term - earnings are significant(investor focus)
SO, LONG TERM INVESTOR SHOULD HAVE A OWNER MINDSET: focus on business not on share price, bcoz if earnings increase market sentiment(P/E) increases and hence share price eventually increases)
5)WHEN TO BUY: 
Index: when both PE and Earnings are less, market_cap/GDP < 1
Stocks: buy Great business at fair price instead of buying fair business at a wonderful price
Seize the opportunity and play big if you get wonderful businesses at great price/undervalued price
Always Invest in tranches bcoz we don't know if the market is gona fall further and we need to have capital to invest more
6)WHEN TO SELL: idea is to hold it forever to get compounding benefit, but in below scenarios we can think of selling securities
Index: when both PE and Earnings are exceptionally high
Stocks: If fundamentals gone bad then u need to sell to protect capital even though u might face minor loss
if fundamentals are good but stock is trading at much higher price than intrinsic value
PS: if fundamentals are good but stock is not trading at fair price then u need to hold, infact u need to accumulate more

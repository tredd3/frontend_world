***** GOLDEN RULES *********
INVEST IN YOURSELF: Read and analyse News - link it with ur investment , Books, finance Videos
CONROL UR EMOTIONS - intrinsic value changes anually, market value changes every minute (make volatility your friend )
LEARN FROM OTHERS MISTAKES - read more and apply them
1)NEVER LOSE CAPITAL
2)RISK LIES IN THE PRICE AND NOT ASSET CLASS - buy assets at cheaper price
Even Buying great companies at higher valuation is also a risky thing 
3)HAVE KNOWLEDGE BEFORE INVESTING - MORE KNOWLEDGE === LESS RISK
Stay in your circle of competence - invest in industries which you understand or believe
4)Short term - PE is significant(speculator focus), long term - earnings are significant(investor focus)
SO, LONG TERM INVESTOR SHOULD HAVE A OWNER MINDSET: focus on business not on share price, bcoz if earnings increase market sentiment(P/E) increases and hence share price eventually increases)
5)WHEN TO BUY: 
Index: when both PE and Earnings are less, market_cap/GDP < 1
Stocks: buy Great business at fair price instead of buying fair business at a wonderful price
Seize the opportunity and play big if you get wonderful businesses at great price/undervalued price
Always Invest in tranches bcoz we don't know if the market is gona fall further and we need to have capital to invest more
6)WHEN TO SELL: idea is to hold it forever to get compounding benefit, but in below scenarios we can think of selling securities
Index: when both PE and Earnings are exceptionally high
Stocks: If fundamentals gone bad then u need to sell to protect capital even though u might face minor loss
if fundamentals are good but stock is trading at much higher price than intrinsic value
PS: if fundamentals are good but stock is not trading at fair price then u need to hold, infact u need to accumulate more


MASTER TIPS & TRICKS:
1)Transfer all your equity amount to debt for stability - if u feel stock markets are going to crash.
Once market crashes and starts to recover put all ur debt amount to equity for growth.
2)if NIFTY and Jr.NIFTY PE is almost same invest in Jr.Nifty as the earnings increase faster in junior nifty

3)if markets crash make sure to invest in junior nifty along with value companies
4)Junior Nifty - only buy when PE is low - During Boom junior nifty grows exponentially and during burst it goes down exponentially

//INDEX INVESTMENT - SAFEST
Stock market going down and down? Invest in Junior Nifty as well but not much, only your risk capital 
1)How to know markets are cheap?
Extremely cheap:
Both Market cap/GDP < 1 and GDP are low, both PE and EPS is low 
Estimated PE:  avg of medium range
Bank PE =100/6 = 18  low PE range = bank PE+5 , low: 23, medium : 23-28, high > 28
Medium costly: 
Either Market cap/GDP < 1 or GDP is low, Either PE or EGR is less
Generally if P/E ratio is more markets are costly but if earnings are less PE will be more and markets are still cheap because
 earnings are less. Hence market_cap/GDP is the right measure.
In the long run market cap/gdp correlation has to be 1 (bcoz company valuation depends on its earnings in the long run)

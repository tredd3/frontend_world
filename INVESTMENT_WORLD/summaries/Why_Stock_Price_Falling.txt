//stock price falls when people are selling stocks heavily reasons can be varied like Fundamentals deteriorating, external environment
  has changed , predictions, opinions, news, macroeconomy concerns,year end tax selling(nov - dec in US, feb - march in India) etc
   - we don't care about all these, we only care about FUNDAMENTALS and data from Authentic source
//Golden fact: Sometimes fundamentals and stock price move in opposite direction for short term

-------------------- SCREENING ----------------------
1)who is selling ?
check promoter shareholding pattern, DII and FII share holding trend in tijori and insider trading in BSE/NSE, 
https://www.tijorifinance.com/company/pi-industries-limited/#trend-shareholding
https://www.screener.in/company/PIIND/consolidated/#shareholding

2)why are they selling?
  Internal factors: temporary problem(can be a buy oppurtunity), permanent problem (skip), if difficult to decide the nature of
   the problem then wait and watch/monitor news etc
  Internal factors check: debt, expenses, asset value compared to mcap(forget about earnings for a while lets assume that company 
  is liquidated today then wt will be its asset worth?)
  External factors: then proceed with screening
  Note: There is stock and there is business behind stock(understand the business)
3)Check valuations(Price/FCF < 15 (check cash as well), PE, PEG, EV/EBITDA, PB)) bcoz high valuation stocks correct in bear markets
  US stocks: Vested (ratios section) - extreme bottom
  Indian Stocks - screener top section
Check Intrinsic value: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nKjmPeIAiBJj7I_hbipXbBysa4ZhoK9qVxh6spmKejo/edit#gid=0
4)Check if it is a value trap: 
 what is a value trap? stock available at low price but it might stay there for few years OR it might decrease further
 how to identify: low quality business available at reasonable valuation like a company with ROCE > 12% , good market share but no
   pricing power available at 5 time FCF. Instead buy a company with ROCE > 10% , decent market share but has pricing power and 
   available at 10-15 times FCF
5)why did you buy the stock? - go through the story
   did the story/fundamentals change? if it significantly changed/impacted then you can sell
6)do you really believe in the stock and have the courage to hold if stock falls further?
i.e can you put 25% of your net worth and forget about it for next 10 yrs in a stock?

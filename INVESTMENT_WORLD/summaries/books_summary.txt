Speculation: No safety of principal - speculator generally expects high returns
Do speculation in a separate account with limited exposure

No co-relation between inflation and earnings:
i.e Just bcoz inflation increases share price/earnings wonâ€™t increase.
in fact it might decrease bcoz people might buy less bcoz of their limited buying power.
However low inflation could be beneficial for businesses
Investments which provide Hedge against inflation: REITs, inflation indexed bonds

** MINDEST ABOVE ALL - don't work hard for survival, work hard to build wealth and protect it from losses, to gain financial skill
 what in in our head determines what is in your hand
** IF YOU CAN'T CONTROL YOUR EMOTIONS YOU CANNOT CONTROL YOUR MONEY
** If you know what you are doing,if you have the clarity then investing is not risky, it's just common sense 
** Choose Time over Money - bcoz Time doesn't/cannot come back, but money does comeback some day or the other
** WEAPONS OF INVESTING - Time, Mind ,have patience , be disciplined
 buy time with money/make effective use of time and train ur brain on how to manage money and make money work for you.
** Only 2 ways of becoming rich/create wealth
 Investing - where you make money work for you
  i)portfolio - stocks, bonds
  ii)passive - real estate
 Business - where you make people work for you
Bcoz salary never made anyone rich, its only the passive/portfolio/business income that made people rich
** By the way you don't have to be an entreprenuer or start a business but u need to have entreprenuer mindset so that
 you can be an executive, earn handsome money and then invest it
** Financial freedom is ultimately decided by your ability to convert 
** Skills needed to create wealth:
 High income skills, investing skills, risk management skills
** Employee focuses on Salary
Business owner focuses on - Revenue profit
Business Investor focuses on - ROI, ROE
**Rich secrets:
wealth is needed for everyone and not restricted to few people
discipline >>>> very important than rate of return or the amount of money invested
people need to think above their salary and try building a product that can fetch money from masses
only time can make rich - wealth can only be made in a long term, u cannot become rich immediately unless u have an excellent business
don't make random investments and think that waiting for 20-30 yrs can make you rich (there needs to be a strategy)
A person can never know everyting (he has to be surrounded by professionals/experts - coach/mentor/magazine subscriptions etc are needed)
invest and forget will only make u lose wealth - continous monitoring is needed(atleast once a week/month)
they become aggressive during crashes and buy high quality assets
strategic use of debt,when used properly and strategically can give multiply your wealth(good debt)
preserving wealth is difficult and important compared to building wealth - keep ur dependents and family well informed

** MY PASSION - mine is to get Rich or be wealthy and have a broader knowledge on things
** MINDEST ABOVE ALL - don't work hard for survival, work hard to build wealth
** IF YOU CAN'T CONTROL YOUR EMOTIONS YOU CANNOT CONTROL YOUR MONEY
** Weapons for investing - know how to make money work for you, how to manage money, have patience , be disciplined


1)Don't focus on reducing expenses rather focus on increasing ur Income
2)if you work for money u will need to pay 30% tax on income, if your money works for you then you only need to pay 10% tax 
3)savings are not for paying expenses, savings are for building assets
4)buy luxury assets(home/car) from the income generated from assets - delay these decisions
5)taking too much loan/debt is strictly prohibited
6)Time === Money - save as much time as possible, even if u have to pay a little bit more money that's ok
 but how are you utilising the time is important
7)Take Risks and learn to manage risk
8)start investing as early as possible to take compounding effect benefit
9)disciplined investing rather than timing the market - react to stock market but don't time it
10)in the long run stock market always goes up so u need to pe patient and be greedy and buy when 
there is a crash or significant correction
11)Revision is more important than new stuff
12)if u run after money because of greed, money will run away from you
13)Always be competing - upgrade ur knowledge,Read daily, have broader knowledge on things,
 follow news, follow investments, personality improvement, attend webinars
14)Don’t care what others think. If u don’t know never hesitate to ask/learn
15)teach children how to mange money and start from where you left but not to start from beginning
 money + with no skills === money lost in very quick time

Telecom - no moats, commodity type service and high regualatoty oversight 
heavily relies on imports - atmnirbhar bharat and PLI schemes can be game changers
capital intensive business
strong financial strength needed to continously improve network (hence generally have high debt)
high fixed cost business (i.e during low demand where revenues can't suffice u need to pay from reserves or even take debt)
highly competetive industry (i.e firms compete on price hence margins are thin)
highly regulated industry (firms need to be flexible enough)
any technology advantages can be easily wiped off by competetitiors by providing similar service
keep in mind to check:
debt, margins, operating leverage (extremely high compared to peers can be deadly combined with high debt)

Utilities - highly regulated sector with commodity type behaviour
Industry: electricity, water
highly regulated sector with constant demand hence it fetches guaranteed but low fixed income(i.e steady cashflows)
highly competetive(low margins) - commodity industry(no pricing power) - high fixed costs(high debt if market share is low)
electricity - generation, tranmission and distribution
/Generation - input:coal/gas/uranium/sunlinght/wind/water output:electricity, deregulated, low enetry barriers, low margins because of competettion
high operating leverage(high fixed costs, only fuel is the variable cost)
/Transmission - trasporatation of electricity from generation plants to grids via wires, regulated, high entry barriers, even though they 
operate as monopolies, still have low margins bcoz of rates regualtion
Note: wireless transmission is a game changer in this industry but is difficult to acheieve as well but not impossible
/Distribution - transmit power from grids to homes/businesses , wide moats bcoz of monopolies but low margins bcoz of regualtion
interms of wide Moats distribution > transmission > generation

Regulations:
state govt regulates structure,costs,competettion of the companies => regulation means low and steady margins
environmental agency regulates the amount of emission by power plants(mainly for coal/thermal plants) - companies must spend on
expensive upgrades to reduce emissions
nuclear agency regulates the nuclear power plants
Note: Regulated companies are safe heavens, deregulation is positive interms of pricing power but negative interms of competetion 
considering its a commodity industry with low entry barriers

Financials:
even though financial are positive they are very less making it less attractive for investors
Don't invest assuming that steady cash flow yields dividends bcoz most companies have high debt
high debt for most companies => all the steady cashflows are used in interest payment
if dividend yield is ridiculosly high => stock price is falling and company is in trouble

Look for :
companies with low debt, stablitiy in financials, operating in stable regulatory environments(i.e having monopoly/less competetion)
and companies that stay focused on its core business rather than entering in to other ventures that are out of its expertise, bcoz
this can lead to bankruptcy.
Especially if u r buy Utility company for dividends make sure to check their debt position and their payout ratio and 
dividend paying history for last 10 yrs

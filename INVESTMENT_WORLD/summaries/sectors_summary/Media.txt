MEDIA - revolution happening in this sector
Generate cash by producing and delivering messages to public
Industry: publishing(newspaper,magazines,novels,books), broadcast(radio,audio(music,podcasts) and video(OTT platforms,movies, shows)),
cable TV(less attractive bcoz satellite TV like Tata sky is taking over), entertainment(not attractive bcoz of one time user fee revenue model)
Revenue Models: one time user fees(watch a new movie, novel, buy CD), subsriptions(cable,newspaper,magazines and OTT), advertisement model
Best model: subsriptions (users pay for services that are delivered at much later date, hence reducing the reliance on outside capital)
economies of scale(subsription based models have high fixed costs giving them significant operating leverage,
 as companies gain market share,profit margins should increase) - avoid companies that need to do continuous CAPEX
Advertisement model - Dont rely on advertisement companies as advertising is the first cost that companies cut during recession 
Deregulations in this sector can help strong players become stronger

MOATS:
publishing and broadcasting (economies of scale by leveraging production equipment and distribution network)
 hence companies in publishing and broadcasting industries continously look for acquistions to increase market share
newspaper(monopolies)
broadcasting(generate revenue via subscriptions and ads, they can only attract ads if they have a significant market share)
intangible assets(brand names, licenses,trademarks,copyrights)

Look for companies:
monopolies or companies with huge market share
generating free cash flows
management wisely using free cashflows
willing to make sensible acquistions(smaller acquistions instead of synergy)

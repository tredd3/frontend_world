dependency on semiconductors and steel
R&D heavy - need to do constant innovation
like supporting engines for petrol blended with ethanol,
electrical vehicles and their support, hydrogen fuel cell technology
Capex for manufacturing


//Engine types
ICE(internal combustion engines) - diesel and petrol vehicles
Mild Hybrid - Engines that run efficiently if used with ethanol blended petrol 
BEV - fully electric
Fuel cell technlogy - green hydrogen
Hybrid - Mild Hybrid + BEV


//Ethanol
organic chemical compound, which is produced from feedstock (sugarcane, sugar, molasses, maize and damaged food grains, etc.), also 
blends with petrol and power vehicles.
why use Ethanol:
A reduction of import dependence on fossils, cost savings, lower emissions(Environment), cost (forex) and extra income for farmers
Ethanol is also a better-quality fuel due to its high-octane number, which enhances engine efficiency 
Govt wants E20 fuel (20 per cent ethanol, 80 per cent petrol), which reduces hydrocarbon effluents by 20 per cent (carbon monoxide by 30-50 per cent)
To meet this ambitious government target, the total ethanol capacity is required to be augmented by three times the capacity as of FY2021.


//Green hydrogen
pass current through water to separate hydrogen and oxygen (power generated should be from solare energy) else it doesn't make 
 any sense.
Dealing with green hydrogen needs lot of expertise which India doesn't have
Major countries in the world are considering to use this fuel as replacement to electric Vehicles or just another type of 
 clean vehicle

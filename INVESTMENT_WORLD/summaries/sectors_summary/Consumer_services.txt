Consumer services
highly competetive sector - no pricing power hence thin margins
low or no barriers to entry
outperform during periods of economic strength and underperform during econoimic weakness
industries: Restaurants(QSR,FSR), retailers(like walmart,Dmart, clothing companies)
with both parents working QSR is increasingly becoming popular
look for companies that provide quality, quick and low cost services
Retailers with CCC -ve , i.e with less inventory and more payable days are bound to be strong
recievable days are negligible for retailers as they collect cash from customers immediately
speciality retaiers like Nike, Puma ,Decatholon have MOATS for short term
only Moat: low cost supplier(economies of scale)

Risk:
changing consumer trends and firms need to match up to that
most consumer services concepts fail in the long run, so if u made investment in a speculative growth stage of a company
 then u need to continously monitor
financials might be inflated bcoz lease amount is not recorded on the balance sheet

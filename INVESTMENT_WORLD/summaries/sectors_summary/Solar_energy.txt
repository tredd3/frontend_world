Photovoltaic panels include one or more PV modules assembled as a pre-wired, field-installable unit.
Solar/PV modules are made up of smaller units called solar cells
Solar cell is made from silicon (second most abundant element on earth)
Light/photons that falls on solar/silicon cells eject the electrons, they travel and go back to where they have left
Each solar cell can give u half a volt
Solar Glass is the protector of solar panels


//Cell efficiency is very important
If the cell  doesn’t absorb sunlight and reflects it then energy is gone
If the electron fallback to a hole before going through the circuit 
Most efficient cell can only convert 46% of photons to electriity
Most commercial systems are only 15-20% efficient  
on extremely hot or cold days when the system DC voltage may exceed the inverter's permissible input voltage range, hence effective solar inverters should also be in the market

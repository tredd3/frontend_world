--Industry: Insurance (mostly avoid but if there is an exceptional company u can consider holding it)
Types: life, general/non-life(health, vehicle, travel, home), reinsurance(transfer risk of premium payment)
stakeholders: insurance products, retail policy holders, corporate policy holders, IRDAI,TPAs(third party agents who does claims 
verfication), re-insurers, distribution network(banks , agents etc),hospitals, AMC(where insurance companies does investment),
 brokers and web aggregators(policy bazaar)
private insurance players are gaining dominance
TPAs like mediassist are the most profitable business model in insurance sector (but the risk is if in house settlement 
 increases, no pricing power as insurance companies decide them, technology disruption can happen) - so take more margin of safety
price de-tarrification is done by IRDAI and now price is decided by competettion

//why general insurance sector?
In india it has huge oppurtunities but competettion is also extreme
huge market size oppurtunity as the penetration is less in india compared to other countries
entry barriers
private players gaining share from PSUs
motor and health insurance is the key followed by crop insurance
in the heath insurance space SAHI(standalone health insurance) companies like start health insurance have done much better than
 GI(general insurance) companies like ICICI lomabard
health insurance growth depends on the retail customers awareness, salary and economy etc

//revenue: 
1)recurring premiums and fees
2)invest the pooled assets and get the profit(kind of similar to banks)
It takes years for Insurance companies to know whether it made money on the policy or not - bcoz the life expectancy , 
future investment value and the time for which an individual will hold the policy is unknown
Also bcoz of the above reasons Insurance company cannot effectively price the policy

//expense:
1)insurance selling costs via agents/banks
2)benefits to shareholders

//financials
complex products and financial statements(lot of assumptions and if assumptions fail the company fails)
gross written premium(GWP): total premiums earned by all the customers
net written premium(NWP): GWP - premiums ceded/paid to reinsures
net premium earned(NPE): the premiums collected counts as earnings only when the policy is near to its end date (hence lesser the policy
 period more quick is the premium realisation as earnings) - NPE is invested in equity/debt/real estate etc
loss ratio: claims/NEP in %
expense ratio: expenses/NWP in %
combined ratio: loss ratio + expense ratio 
combined ratio < 100% means company is making an underwriting profit and management may be efficient in managing expenses
combined ratio > 100% means company outlow(claim amount) is more than inflow(premium amount) => loss but
 it can be offset by investment income, so it is very imp to monitor AUI and their quality


MOAT CHECK: weak moats in general
brand
distribution network
diversification of products
assumption heavy business - so conservative accounting assumptions is preferred
established relationship with corporate consumers - ensures stability
consistent ROE and ROCE above 15%
annual premium growth rate not too high
credit rating
investment portfolio quality
low cost provider with volumes? but shouldn't sell unprofitable insurance policies
did it survive a disaster in the past(2008, 2021)
unique product: i.e providing insurance for those items which competetitiors don't provide

RISK:
extremely competetive - difficult to build a moat for longterm bcoz of commodity products which can be easily replaced
mostly a no MOAT business with thin margins, hence acquistions are needed for sustainace
big annuity business - risky investment as the exposure to equities is more
no pricing power : public always prefer low cost products, corporate clients also generally interfere in pricing,
some competetitiors price the policies so low and are ready to take losses in balance sheet to gain market share that will
eventually effect other firms profits. e.g LIC
cyclicality: even though it is a mature business since the profits are tied to market returns, in the bull market returns are good
and premiums are less but in during crash/bear markets premiums need to be increased to make profits but if competetitiors still keep 
it low then the firm suffers

Risks specific to health insurance:
increase in health care costs
mass health infection like COVID/natural calamity etc
Regulatory risk: IRDAI is considering to allow life insurers to sell health insurance considering their reach and also 
 globally it is allowed. this will be -ve for SAHI(standalone health insurance) companies and GI(general insurance) companies
investment risk - financial crisis/ economic recession/interest rate risk can yield low results
Also corporates are providing health insurance now a days - so check 


//Life Insurance
India is under protected and not under penetrated - because of mix of investment + insurance
reinsurance companies are globally diversified(GIC, SWISS RE)
products based on customer needs:
1)savings: linked(ULIP, linked to stock markets), non-linked(participating(like bonus, mobeyback), non-participating(guaranteed return))
participating - participating in the returns which insurer has invested in (usually in bonds)
2)protection: term plan, life, health, disability etc


//why Life insurance sector?
as it is a must for everyone

//business
high margin business : term plans/protection > non participating > participating > ULIP
non participating - investors/share holders are most benefitted
participating - customers are most benefitted

//financials
persistency ratio : higher persistency means certainity of profts is high(i.e premiums are being paid out by insurance holders)
complaint ratio: low is preferred, if it is higher surrender rates will be higher and persistency will be less
solvency ratio: higher it is more guaranteed that insurer is gonna pay premiums, min is 150% as set by IRDAI
cost ratio: less is better (operating expenses + commission expenses)/premium
expenses are incurred and not amorotised over years, but profits are realized over years 

//players
LIC - strong agent network
HDFC LIFE - diversified distribution including HDFC Bank, diversified product base, cost ratio is high because of its focus on
 agent expansion by acquiring exide life insurance, aggressive accounting , expensive valuations
ICICI PRUDENTIAL - strong bancassurance, subsidary of ICICI bank, focusing on diverse product mix, conservative accounting,
 excellent asset quality with conservative investment even in bonds, significant ULIP product mix which can be deadly in bear
 markets, ICICI is trying to reduce that mix
SBI Life - strong bancassurance, subsidary of SBI bank, low protection prodcuts and high reliance on ULIP(low margin business),
cost efficient in the entire industry with very less cost ratio

//moats specific to life insurance
high persistency ratio
less surrender , cost and complaint ratio
share of protection should be high


//Risks specific to Life insurance:
tax rate, currently it is 12.5% but it can be 25% so keep an eye while buying
be very strict in 

//PolicyBazaar
initially web aggregator but now becoming a broker with offline presence

Risk for PolicyBazaar:
new players
people might compare on the platform but buy from actual site
what if insurance players withdraw - especially the big ones

--Industry: Insurance (mostly avoid but if there is an exceptional company u can consider holding it)
Types: life, general/non-life(health, vehicle, travel, home), reinsurance(transfer risk of premium payment)
stakeholders: retail policy holders, corporate policy holders, IRDAI,TPAs(third party agents who does claims verfication),
 re-insurers, hospitals, AMC(where they insurance companies does investment)
private insurance players are gaining dominance
TPAs like mediassist are the most profitable business model in insurance sector (but the risk is if in house settlement 
 increases, no pricing power as insurance companies decide them, technology disruption can happen) - so take more margin of safety
price de-tarrification is done by IRDAI and now price is decided by competettion

//why general insurance sector?
In india it has huge oppurtunities but competettion is also extreme
huge market size oppurtunity as the penetration is less in india compared to other countries
entry barriers
private players gaining share from PSUs
motor and health insurance is the key followed by crop insurance
in the heath insurance space SAHI(standalone health insurance) companies like start health insurance have done much better than
 GI(general insurance) companies like ICICI lomabard
health insurance growth depends on the retail customers awareness, salary and economy etc

//revenue: 
1)recurring premiums and fees
2)invest the pooled assets and get the profit(kind of similar to banks)
It takes years for Insurance companies to know whether it made money on the policy or not - bcoz the life expectancy , 
future investment value and the time for which an individual will hold the policy is unknown
Also bcoz of the above reasons Insurance company cannot effectively price the policy

//expense:
1)insurance selling costs via agents/banks
2)benefits to shareholders

//financials
complex products and financial statements(lot of assumptions and if assumptions fail the company fails)
gross written premium(GWP): total premiums earned by all the customers
net written premium(NWP): GWP - premiums ceded/paid to reinsures
net premium earned(NPE): the premiums collected counts as earnings only when the policy is near to its end date (hence lesser the policy
 period more quick is the premium realisation as earnings) - NPE is invested in equity/debt/real estate etc
loss ratio: claims/NEP in %
expense ratio: expenses/NWP in %
combined ratio: loss ratio + expense ratio 
combined ratio < 100% means company is making an underwriting profit and management may be efficient in managing expenses
combined ratio > 100% means company outlow(claim amount) is more than inflow(premium amount) => loss but
 it can be offset by investment income, so it is very imp to monitor AUI and their quality

MOAT CHECK: weak moats in general
brand
distribution network
diversification of products
established relationship with corporate consumers - ensures stability
consistent ROE and ROCE above 15%
annual premium growth rate not too high
credit rating
investment portfolio quality
low cost provider with volumes? but shouldn't sell unprofitable insurance policies
did it survive a disaster in the past(2008, 2021)
unique product: i.e providing insurance for those items which competetitiors don't provide

RISK:
extremely competetive - difficult to build a moat for longterm bcoz of commodity products which can be easily replaced
mostly a no MOAT business with thin margins, hence acquistions are needed for sustainace
big annuity business - risky investment as the exposure to equities is more
no pricing power : public always prefer low cost products, corporate clients also generally interfere in pricing,
some competetitiors price the policies so low and are ready to take losses in balance sheet to gain market share that will
eventually effect other firms profits. e.g LIC
cyclicality: even though it is a mature business since the profits are tied to market returns, in the bull market returns are good
and premiums are less but in during crash/bear markets premiums need to be increased to make profits but if competetitiors still keep 
it low then the firm suffers

Risks specific to health insurance:
increase in health care costs
mass health infection like COVID/natural calamity etc
Regulatory risk: IRDAI is considering to allow life insurers to sell health insurance considering their reach and also 
 globally it is allowed. this will be -ve for SAHI(standalone health insurance) companies and GI(general insurance) companies
investment risk - financial crisis/ economic recession/interest rate risk can yield low results
Also corporates are providing health insurance now a days - so check

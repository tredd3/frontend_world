Hardware (difficult to build moats and is cyclical)
industry: semiconductors, PCs, Telecom equipment, contrcat manufacturing(like DIXON)
failure and bankruptcy stories are more than success stories in this sector.so be carefull and pick wisely
growth drivers:
1)R&D, technological advances are must forcing firms to spend on R&D
2)tight coupling between hardware and software: advanced software needs hitech hardware to run smoothly
3)hardware demand is more than the economy growth
intense price competetion: over the years all the technology advancements are passed on to consumers at a lesser price
cyclical: corporates contribute more towards total hardware sales so during recession they cut down spending on upgradation
strong competetion - very less entry barriers as well
consumer spending also highly varies based on unemployment and minimum wages
contract manufacturing companies should make sure that client commit certain volume so that they can take informed decision
 on employee costs and manufacturing, else they mindlessly increase capex assuming that demand continues and when demand slows 
 down the debt level increases to service capex as revenues cannot meet the needs.

oats:
durable market share and consistent profitability
low cost producer like dell(high sales)
niche products manufacturer(where there is scarcity of qualified staff and a new entrant possibly cannot overpower existing firms)
more diverse and unique products
large network effect like cisco where its products can be integrated with almost any hardware
superior technology advantages(but it has to be complemented by above 3 else this moat alone cannot sustain long enough)
high switching costs - especially for telecom equipment manufactures
must have flexible economics(like outsource manufacturing to contract manufacturing companies like DIXON) so whenever
 demand is low u can cut down manufacturing and save costs
cutting costs wherever possible like outsource manufacturing, eliminating third party sales middlemen etc

Keep in Mind:
check inventory turnover: old stock goes for very less price meaning large inventory pileup leads to losses if not sold fast
inventory growth shouldn't be more compared to sales growth
moated companies in this industry haven't build moat on technology advantages alone, bcoz technology in itself doesn't have any moat

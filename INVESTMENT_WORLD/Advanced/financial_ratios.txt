//financial ratios  compare with the company 10yrs performance, competitors and industry to know the actual value/performance
ROS - return on sales - GPM, OPM, NET PROFIT MARGIN
ROI - return on investment: ROE, ROCE

1)P/E <  20 - no need to check growth
PE > 20 -  check if growth is fast and PEG < 1.3
every sector has a different PE, also PE numbers can be misleading due to earnings 
If a company’s PE is more that means investor is paying premium bcoz it’s a high growth industry and assuming that potential earnings growth will be more
How to know whether this premium is justified? 
PEG=PE/CAGR(Growth in net profit/net income/free cash flow for last 10 yrs)
All B2C companies should be valued based on PE (FMCG) and not on PB
NOTE :
low P/E might not mean company is undervalued, company may be bankrupt in few years or their future may be skeptical or some negative news which might impact the business
High P/E might not mean market is paying a premium price bcoz of positive sentiment, it can also mean earnings are less.
Conclusion: Both high and low P/E has flaws, so focus on the earnings 
2)D/E - debt to equity should be < 0.5
If D/E is high and if earnings decreases bcoz of business/economy slowdown then company will collapse and you will loose the capital
if it is low then and ur shareholder base increases is also bad (as the money gets distributed lifetime) as Equity is costly(lifetime dividend payment from profits), debt is cheap(one time clearance)
Reasons for Less debt: 
** no growth plans
** no one is giving u debt bcoz of less credit worthiness
** company is strong enough to finance all its future needs - required
For Great companies - D/E is 0 
3)ROE - return on equity = Net profit/Total equity = rate at which equity/shareholders money grows 
ROE should be  > 15% else better to invest in index funds
Total equity = share capital + reserves + preferred equity
4)P/B - market value per share to book value per share
ROE and P/B must be in sync 
considered only for capex/heavy industries like energy, realty etc
Book value/net worth/net assets/equity= total assets - liabilities (Intangible assets such as patents,copyrights, brand recognition, and goodwill are not included in the balance sheet)
in simple words book value is what shareholders get after company is liquidated/sold and it's liabilities are paid off
When to buy based on PB: for a new company where earnings haven’t begun, B2B(ONGC,GAIL) exceptions for companies like L&T, Intel bcoz they established a sense of trust in customers
PB value should be < 1.5 for great valuation
5)EPS - always TTM (trailing 12 months) net profit  is considered 
formula: net profit/total no.of outstanding shares
6)ROCE - return on capital employed = EBIT/Total equity + non-current liabilities
golden rule: ROCE > WACC of company, if not equity amount(reserves part) is gradually reduced and becomes zero,leading to bankruptcy
7)ROA - net profit/Total assets

***** Portfolio Framework***** 
Golden/Thumb rules:
—Cash is not good investment - inflation will reduce its worth Invest in productive assets
—Patience is the key to success in stock market
—Compounding is the 8th wonder - time is the key, make the most of it by investing early
—when everyone is greedy be fearful and when everyone is fearful be greedy
— portfolio diversification - very important but why?
Even across MFs(diff varieties) and stocks(diff sectors)
e.g: assume there are 100 MFs, only few MFs can beat the index, others will underperform in a way that the average return of all 100MFs will be equal to index
If u park all ur finds in a single MF or a sector there is a very high chance that it might underperform bcoz only few can beat the index
Also same concept is applicable to sectors and individual stocks as well
e.g: lets say Bank sector will grow by 20% then few banks grow more than 20% and others will grow less than 20% such that average growth of all banks will be equal to 20%
So better to invest in a sector rather than individual banks if u know banking sector will do good
—investment decision depends on - age, risk appetite, duration, goal, market condition
—Play big and don’t waste opportunity - but prefer to invest in tranches bcoz no-one knows by what margin markets go down further.U can’t risk losing capital

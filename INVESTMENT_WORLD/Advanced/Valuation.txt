***** Company Valuation ******
There's no one method that's best suited for every situation. Each stock is different, and each industry or sector
 has unique characteristics that may require multiple valuation methods.

//Valuation Terminology:
**capital: equity +debt
**Market cap is the total value of all outstanding shares of the company's stock. It is calculated by multiplying the stock's current share price and the number of shares outstanding.
Market cap gives you an idea of the growth and risk to expect from a particular stock. Companies are classified according to market capitalization. 
The broad categories are large-, mid-, and small-cap.
Large-cap companies are well-established successful companies with steady streams of revenue. Their growth over time may be slow but steady. 
small-cap stocks are those that are experiencing accelerated growth, but that
large cap: 1-100
bluechip: largest of top 100
midcap: 101 - 250 
small cap: 251 - 500
nano: 500+
**Enterprise value(EV) is a more accurate measure of a company's real worth because it takes into consideration its debt obligations. 
EV = market_cap +  outstanding preferred stock + all debt(short and long term) - all of its cash and cash equivalents.
i.e if u want to buy a company, u need to pay the shareholders, lenders. However u will get the cash held by company


//if looking for dividend:
dividend payout > 40% - good | industry leaders do that
dividend payout ratio is the ratio of the total amount of dividends paid out to shareholders relative to the net income of the company
Dividend yield > bank interest rates (6%)
Dividend yield  = dividend_amount/share_price * 100


//TWO VALUATION MODELS:
1)Absolute valuation: find the intrinsic value of company by focusing on things as dividends, cash flow, and the growth rate for a single company, and not worry about any other companies.
Valuation models in this category : dividend discount model, discounted cash flow model, residual income model, and asset-based model.

** which companies can use below DCF valuation model:
only if a business is predictable
i.e OPM, NPM  steady/Increasing and cash flows are increasing
then  cash flows can be discounted and we can arrive at fair value for the company

**Discounted cash flow model - PV of growing perpetuity
Fair value= Free cash flows/(rate-growth)
Discount Rate = minimum expected return rate per year by the company for infinite period (WACC is generally used)
WACC is the minimum required return for a firm (expected equity returns by shareholder is roughly 14% + debt cost is the interest rate at which company took the loan)
companies always target to earn more returns than WACC
go through EY, BCG,Chief Economic Advisor reports on sector growth. expected sector growth should be >= WACC
Benchmark rates: 
low risk = 6%(govt 10 yr bond yield)
Medium	risk = 15%(Nifty)
High risk= > 20%(individual stocks/sectors/MFs etc) 
PS: since we invest in great companies , risk factor is low and hence we need to discount based on risk free rate
MOS(margin of safety) for stable and predictable firms : 10-20%
MOS(margin of safety) for non-predictable firms : 30-50%
small/mid cap, cyclical , debt heavy, capex heavy industries discount rate is more as the risk is more
**But why is margin of safety is needed?
DCF requires making many assumptions. The future cash flow assumption might go wrong as it rely on a variety of factors, 
such as market demand, the status of the economy, technology, competition, and unforeseen threats or opportunities
Growth = by what % does free cash flow grow every year (assumption is 5%)
Why 5% - since we invest in great businesses, over long period they might have become big and the only for them to grow is when economy grows
i.e Economy growth will become company growth
Economy growth = global nominal growth/ India’s nominal growth = 5%
e.g 1: long_term investment
Free Cash flow =10lakhs
rate=0.07 (risk free rate)
growth=0.05
Fair value=10/0.07-0.05 =10/0.02= 5 cr
So we need buy this company for  < 50% of 5 cr == < 2.5 cr
e.g 2: short_term investment
Fair value calculation for immediate year:
Fair value = estimated earnings * Fair PE (roughly 27-28 as of 2021)
estimated earnings  = 14% increase on previous year earnings (10% actual + 4% inflation)
Margin of safety(MOS) = 30% - 50%
Purchase value = MOS * fair value

2)Relative valuation: 
compare financial ratios and EV/EBITDA with other companies in the SAME sector and same industry ,also of same size to know
the actual value/performance compared to peers .
P/E of similar companies (ICICI, HDFC but don’t compare ICICI with Dena bcoz of diff in scale, area of operation,
 products ,management etc )

PS: unfortunately all valuation methods yield different values. Moreover different sectors need dfifferent kinds of valuation
like e-commerece mostly based on sales, FMCG and consulting based on free cash flows,  new companies based on P/B,
capex intensive companies based on EBITDA

E.g of Real world scenario:
Historical cash flow growth: CAGR of free cashflows for last 10yrs (take avg of  3yrs cash flows incase of heavy fluctuations)
Industry reports:  As u cannot rely on historical data always read EY, BCG,Chief Economic Advisor reports on specific sectors/industry growth and consider the weighted avg growth
of all sectors in which company has revenue from 
ITC business revenue share:
65% tobacco - tobacco estimated to grow at 6%
35% FMCG - 20% estimated growth
Overall weighted growth = 0.65*6+0.35*20=11
Assuming company grows 8% for next 5yrs and then slow down to 5% for rest of the time
Calculation of PV:
Then say in the year 2020 cashflow value is x
Till 2025 cashflow = previous year cash flow*1.11
Till 2030 cashflow=previous year cash flow*1.08
From 2031 cashflow increases @5%
In the year 2030 total cash flows = 2029 cashflow*1.08 + PV of future cashflows from 2030(growing perpetuity formula)
Calculate PV value of total 2030 cashflows using PV formula
Discounted value = 50% of PV value of total 2030 cashflows 
Market Cap should be less than discounted value to go for a buy

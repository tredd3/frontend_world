//financial ratios  compare with the company 10yrs performance, competitors and industry average to know the performance
ROS - return on sales - GPM, OPM, NET PROFIT MARGIN
ROI - return on investment: ROE, ROCE

1)P/E <  20 - no need to check growth
PE > 20 -  check if growth is fast and PEG < 1.3
every sector has a different PE, also PE numbers can be misleading due to earnings 
If a company’s PE is more that means investor is paying premium bcoz it’s a high growth industry and assuming that potential earnings growth will be more
All B2C companies should be valued based on PE (FMCG) and not on PB
PE is specific to sector so always compare stocks within the sector
problems with PE:
-earnings can be manipulated by management so don't forget to (look at cashflow and income statement to figure it out)
-PE doesn't consider future earnings it only considers past earnings - but investors invest in future (look at PEG)
-even in past earnings, quality of earnings is not reflected, i.e by looking at PE we don't know whether the earnings are from
 sales and internal accruals/debt (look at price/free cashflow or price/cashflow as cashflow cannot be manipulated)
price/FCF: price per share/free cash flow generated per share
-cyclical companies PE is low so this can be misleading
**How to know whether this premium is justified? 
PEG=PE/expected annual EPS growth rate(Growth in net profit/net income/free cash flow for past 10 yrs)
PEG =1 fairlyvalued
PEG < 1 undervalued
PEG >1 overvalued
NOTE :
low P/E might not mean company is undervalued, company may be bankrupt in few years or their future may be skeptical or some negative news which might impact the business
High P/E might not mean market is paying a premium price bcoz of positive sentiment, it can also mean earnings are less.
Conclusion: Both high and low P/E has flaws, so focus on the earnings(growth rate) 
2)D/E - debt to equity should be < 0.5
If D/E is high and if earnings decreases bcoz of business/economy slowdown then company will collapse and you will loose the capital
if it is low then and ur shareholder base increases is also bad (as the money gets distributed lifetime) as Equity is costly(lifetime dividend payment from profits), debt is cheap(one time clearance)
Reasons for Less debt: 
** no growth plans
** no one is giving u debt bcoz of less credit worthiness
** company is strong enough to finance all its future needs - required
For Great companies - D/E is 0 
3)ROE - return on equity = Net profit/Total equity = rate at which equity/shareholders money grows 
ROE should be  > 15% else better to invest in index funds
Total equity = share capital + reserves + preferred equity
4)P/B - market value per share to book value per share
if PB is high check ROA.ROA should be high
considered only for capex/heavy industries like energy, realty etc
Book value/net worth/net assets/equity= total assets - liabilities (Intangible assets such as patents,copyrights, brand recognition, and goodwill are not included in the balance sheet)
in simple words book value is what shareholders get after company is liquidated/sold and it's liabilities are paid off
When to buy based on PB: for a new company where earnings haven’t begun, B2B(ONGC,GAIL) exceptions for companies like L&T, Intel bcoz they established a sense of trust in customers
PB value should be < 3 for great valuation
5)EPS - always TTM (trailing 12 months) net profit  is considered 
formula: (net profit - preferred dividends)/total no.of outstanding shares
6)ROCE - return on capital employed = EBIT/Total equity + non-current liabilities
golden rule: ROCE > WACC of company, if not equity amount(reserves part) is gradually reduced and becomes zero,leading to bankruptcy
7)ROA - net profit/Total assets
8)EV/EBITDA :
EBITDA measures a firm's overall financial performance
while EV determines the firm's total value = market cap + total debt - cash and cash equivalents
(assume u r buying a company, total value/cash u need to pay shareholders and to creditors is nothing but EV)
**why EV/EBITDA is considered a better valuation tool?
i)It is possible to obtain fair comparisons of companies that have different capital structures(t is not affected by changes in a company’s capital structure )
ii)it eliminates the effects of noncash expenses (which doesn't affect the cashflow)
EV/EBITDA < 10 //undervalued
EV/EBITDA < 15 //fairly valued 
but compare it with peers of same size within same sector just like we do it for PE

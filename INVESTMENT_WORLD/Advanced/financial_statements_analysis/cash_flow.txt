//why cash flow statement is important
p&l statement can be manipulated. Also not all the net profit is received as cash, it takes time for the money to get credited 
also that money goes in to reserve section of balance sheet, hence analysing free cashflow is very important.
also check that net profit and cash flow should be in sync, if not investigate why company is not able to convert profit to cash

Cash flow from Investing activities - 
Capex: investment in fixed assets like plant, machinery, buildings etc
investment in bonds,MFs, stocks of other companies etc
subsidary investments
selling and buying assets
interest and dividends
Cash flow from financing activities - cash flows between a company and its owners/shareholders and creditors from activities such as issuing bonds, retiring bonds, selling stock or buying back stock,IPO,FPO etc.
Cash flow from Operating activities(CFO) - earnings from core/daily activities of a company involved in producing and selling its product, generating revenues, manufacturing, sales, advertising, and marketing activities

**Net cash flow = CIO + CFO + COO
A negative cash flow does not mean a company is unable to pay all of its obligations; it just means that the amount of cash received
 for that period was insufficient to cover its obligations for that same time period. If other savings vehicles are liquidated 
 to meet the obligation—or additional debt is accrued 
Analyzing what activities contribute to positive or negative net cash is essential


**Free cash flow = owner’s earnings = Net Cash flow from Operating activities(CFO) - Capex
= net profit + non_cash expenses(like depriciation,amortisation) - change in working capital - Capex
owner’s earnings = if u buy a company u can take home this cash from company bank account without damaging the core business


**If free cash flow is high => reserves increases => equity increases and ROE decreases
Hence companies either use it in Capex(capacity increase),R&D(tech companies), mergers(to acquire market share/expansion)
If a company has more cash in ideal mode then it might take wrong decision and everything gets screwed.
Hence they give it as dividend or buyback shares from open market then cash decreases and the ROE is less
Generally FMCG gives dividend and tech companies won’t rather they invest in R&D to keep ahead of competition.


**if free cash flow is -ve
debt/equity/reserves will be used up 
consistently -ve free cashflow is bad

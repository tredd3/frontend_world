//why cash flow statement is important
p&l statement can be manipulated. Also not all the net profit is received as cash, it takes time for the money to get credited 
also that money goes in to reserve section of balance sheet, hence analysing free cashflow is very important.
also check that net profit and cash flow should be in sync, if not investigate why company is not able to convert profit to cash

Cash flow from Investing activities - 
Capex: investment in fixed assets like plant, machinery, buildings etc
investment in bonds,MFs, stocks of other companies etc
subsidary investments
selling and buying assets
interest and dividends
Cash flow from financing activities - cash flows between a company and its owners/shareholders and creditors from activities such as issuing bonds, retiring bonds, selling stock or buying back stock,IPO,FPO etc.
Cash flow from Operating activities(CFO) - earnings from core/daily activities of a company involved in producing and selling its product, generating revenues, manufacturing, sales, advertising, and marketing activities

**Net cash flow = CIO + CFO + COO
A negative cash flow does not mean a company is unable to pay all of its obligations; it just means that the amount of cash received
 for that period was insufficient to cover its obligations for that same time period. If other savings vehicles are liquidated 
 to meet the obligation—or additional debt is accrued 
Analyzing what activities contribute to positive or negative net cash is essential


**Free cash flow = owner’s earnings = Net Cash flow from Operating activities(CFO) - Capex
= net profit + non_cash expenses(like depriciation,amortisation) - change in working capital - Capex
free cash flow is the cash that can be taken from company bank account without damaging the core business
owner’s earnings = if u buy a company u can take this free cash flow home , hence they become your earnings

Company is called extraorinary  if free cash flow > 70% of net profit (u can check freecashflow on tijori/morningstar)

**If free cash flow is high => assets increases => equity increases and ROE decreases
Hence companies either use it in Capex(capacity increase),R&D(tech companies), mergers(to acquire market share/expansion)
If a company has more cash in ideal mode then it might take wrong decision and everything gets screwed.
Hence they give it as dividend or buyback shares from open market then cash decreases and the ROE is less
Generally FMCG gives dividend and tech companies won’t rather they invest in R&D to keep ahead of competition.
**CAGR - compounded annual growth rate -  on an average return rate per year
For e.g: 2015 - investment year, 9% is CAGR which means from 2015 to 2016 there is 9% profit, and whole amount(principal + profit) is reinvested and then again 9% profit on the amount and so on
**Beta analysis
Beta - A positive beta value indicates that stocks generally move in the same direction with that of the market and the vice versa
For example, if beta is 1.3 and the market is expected to move up by 10%, then the stock should move up by 13% (1.3 x 10).

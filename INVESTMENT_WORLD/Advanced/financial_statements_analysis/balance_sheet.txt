The balance sheet is a snapshot, representing the state of a company's finances (what it owns and owes) as of the date of publication.

what idea does balance sheet give us?
solvency: ability to clear debt
liquidity: can it meet short term expenses


**liabilities: source of funds, i.e from where does the company get money from
Equity:
equity share capital - promoter share value
other equity - reserves + retained earnings + premium paid during IPO,FPO share offers
Non-current liabilities: to be paid for a period > 1 year
 borrowings - long term debt
Other financial liabilities - like TDS for dividends declared
Other liabilities  -
 Provisions - set aside some amount for unseen future expenses
Current liabilities: to be paid within 1 year

**assets: how the company is utilising the money
current assets - can be liquidated within a year
'Net Block' - the original cost of acquisition of tangible assets(property,plants,equipments) - depreciation
Note: current market value of tangible assets might be less/ more
working assets/current assets cycle:
cash used to buy inventory => inventory gets converted to accounts recievables => accounts recievables get converted to cash => repeat
cash pile is due to 3 reasons:
-by issuing bonds, equities or taking loan
-by sell exisiting business or companies assets 
-by business operations : this implies company has a DCA
long term investments: investment in stocks,bonds of other companies or subsidaries and real estate 
the value in balance sheet is the value at which the company has bought the assets and not the current market value.
i.e the company might be holding businesses with DCA whose market value is much more than the value shown

**shareholder equity
both common and preferred stocks value in balance sheet is par/face value
Additional paid-in capital or capital surplus represents the amount shareholders have invested in excess of the "common stock" 
or "preferred stock" par value during ipo time or QIP time
Note: these values are not market values, rather the values at which the investors hace acquired stocks in the past
Retained earnings are the net earnings a company either reinvests in the business or use to pay off debt or dividends to shareholders
or capex/expansion or buyback of shares or acquistion 
Treasury stock is the stock a company has repurchased. It can be sold at a later date to raise cash or reserved to repel a hostile takeover.

Non-current liabilities: to be paid for a period > 1 year
 borrowings - long term debt
Other financial liabilities - like TDS for dividends declared

 Provisions - set aside some amount for unseen future expenses
Current liabilities: to be paid within 1 year

**assets: how the company is utilising the money
current assets - can be liquidated within a year
'Net Block' - the original cost of acquisition of tangible assets(property,plants,equipments) - depreciation

Sales/revenue/turnover/topline
COGS - cost of goods sold (preparation/making price)

Gross Profit = sales - COGS

Gross profit Margin/Gross Margin = (gross Profit/sales) *100
consistent higher gross proft margin represents pricing power/brand/strong MOATs or company is reducing input costs
if 2 similar companies cost of goods sold remains but GPM is higher for a company implies company has competettive advantage

Operating expenses = salaries + building rent + advertising + marketing cost + cash burn to beat the price war + R&D cost 

EBITDA=Gross Profit - Operating expenses (profit earned by a company from its business)

depreciation expenses = capital goods(like electronics/machinery/buildings) value depreciates over time and is included in income statement over say 5-10 yrs
Amortisation expenses = same as depreciation but amortisation is for intangible assets like patents
--amort and depre should be in the range of 5-10% 0f fixed assets
5% means fixed assets will be replaced in 20 yrs
10% means fixed assets will be replaced in 10 yrs
for capex heavy industries 20 - 25% is preferred
--also amort and dep expenses should be usually in the range of 8-12%
if the above % are less => earnings inflated , stock is heavily overvalued
if the above % are more => earnings impacted , stock is undervalued

Operating Profit /Operating income(EBIT) =EBITDA - Depreciation - Amortisation expenses=Gross Profit - Operating expenses - Depreciation - Amortisation expenses 

Operating Profit margin/Operating Margin =(operating profit/sales) *100
Operating profit margin shouldn’t be negative, consistent higher OPM implies having better/efficient management

PBT = Operating Profit /Operating income(EBIT) - interest payment on debt 

PAT/Net Income/Net Profit/BottomLine/Earnings = PBT - tax

ICR(interest coverage ratio) = EBITDA/Interest = will the company be able to pay interest on debt. ICR should always be high so that
during recession company can interest on its debt without loosing assets.
ICR is not applicable for companies with 0 debt.

**why EBITDA is important even thouh PAT/net profit exist?
for capital intensive business we need to look in to EBITDA, which gives us the actual operating income as dep & amor numbers will be high
for comparing actual operating income of old company (which already claimed dep and amo expenses) and new company(whose dep & amo expenses are being claimed)
also amortisation and depreciation are non-cash expenses, which doesn't go out from company's hand\

** Trends and interpretation 
—-Both top line and bottom line is growing - extraordinary businesses
I.e Gross profit Margin is either steady or increasing
—-Bottomline is growing fast but top line growth is slow - company having great moat
i.e people are paying premium and has customer loyalty
—-Top line is growing but bottomline is not - bad business modal bcoz company is  trying to capture the market share first and 
then earn profits. But will the customers come back to the company for purchases? Is there any such moat ? 
If yes - then definitely a good business
If No - means other players will enter into market and current company will face losses

Sales/revenue/turnover/topline
COGS - cost of goods sold (preparation/making price)
Gross Profit = sales - COGS
Gross profit Margin/Gross Margin = (gross Profit/sales) *100
consistent higher gross proft margin represents pricing power/brand/strong MOATs or company is reducing input costs
if 2 similar companies cost of goods sold remains but GPM is higher for a company implies company has competettive advantage
Operating expenses = salaries + building rent + advertising + marketing cost + cash burn to beat the price war + R&D cost 
EBITDA=Gross Profit - Operating expenses (profit earned by a company from its business)
depreciation expenses = capital goods(like electronics/machinery/buildings) value depreciates over time and is included in income statement over say 5-10 yrs
Amortisation expenses = same as depreciation but amortisation is for intangible assets like patents
Operating Profit /Operating income(EBIT) =EBITDA - Depreciation - Amortisation expenses=Gross Profit - Operating expenses - Depreciation - Amortisation expenses 
Operating Profit margin/Operating Margin =(operating profit/sales) *100
Operating profit margin shouldnâ€™t be negative, consistent higher OPM implies having better/efficient management
PBT = Operating Profit /Operating income(EBIT) - interest payment on debt 
PAT/Net Income/Net Profit/BottomLine/Earnings = PBT - tax
ICR(interest coverage ratio) = EBITDA/Interest = will the company be able to pay interest on debt. ICR should always be high so that during recession company can interest on its debt without loosing assets.
ICR is not applicable for companies with 0 debt.

why EBITDA is important even thouh PAT/net profit exist?
for capital intensive business we need to look in to EBITDA, which gives us the actual operating income as dep & amor numbers will be high
for comparing actual operating income of old company (which already claimed dep and amo expenses) and new company(whose dep & amo expenses are being claimed)
also amortisation and depreciation are non-cash expenses, which doesn't go out from company's hand

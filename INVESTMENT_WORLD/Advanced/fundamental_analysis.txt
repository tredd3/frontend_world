fundamental analysis is broadly divided in to 2 :
1)qualitative analysis 
2)quantitative analysis: financial statements + business info(market share, revenue model, geographical presence)
https://www.tijorifinance.com/company/tata-steel-limited/#marketshare
also u can compare financial statements and business info across peers - which currently only tijori provides

1)discover - once you have picked stocks suitable to you and your competence using how_to_pick_stocks.txt ,
 proceed with the fundamental analysis below

2)steps/research involved :
mindset: analyse with a fraud identification mindset and not with a confirmation bias
i)management analysis - qualitative analysis

***integrity: how honest is the management and their moral values like not misusing cash in their favour,instead giving importance to shareholders
*remuneration : < 5% of profits | when company in bad state remuneration should be still lesser | should be in limits prescribed by MCA | 
search for management in annual report
*related party transactions: transactions to benifit holding company,director/director relations,key management and relations,subsidary companies
*track record: criminal, scams, warnings from SEBI/RBI - google search by promoter name / http://www.suchetadalal.com/
*should focus on business and not on additional stuff like share price
*regularly CFOs, auditors resign - avoid such companies
*management should do what they say and should take responsibilty of things that didn't work (past 5yrs management section)
*promoter pledging - know how much is pledged and the reason for pleding - if more shares are pledged company can go out of hand

***skill test: you can get it from company about section/ annual report management section(past 5 yrs)
qualifications(relevant skills are necessary)
experience(more experience means managers seen boom and burst and knows how to behave in each situation) 
mindset : growth, comfort zone - growth preferred
retained earnings: how is retained earnings used and what is the return on the invested earnings
age: if management is old, sucession plan is important

ii)industry analysis
*life cycle of an industry - 4 stages
pioneering - EV, green energy
growth - internet
maturity/saturation - FMCG
decling - obselete - TV channels, print media
you need to identify the current phase of the industry and read reports on the industry
*REPORTS: read and findout the oppurtunities, profits scope and risks/threats involved in the industry

*further analysis
1)level of competetion - don't invest in industries where there is huge competetion within companies, as the pricing power decreases
2)threat of new entrants - how easy it is for a new entrant to disrupt the market share(jio for telecom, jiomart for dmart)
3)threat of substitutes - EVs vs auto industries, OTT vs TV channels
4)bargaining power of suppliers - if suppliers has more bargaining power than the company itself then profits will be skewed
5)bargaining power of buyers - if client base is limited then company doesn't have a choice but to sell the products 
at a lower price, if the buyer demands so
6)high entry barrier - is a good sign, capex heavy, momopoly, difficult to manufacture, strict regulations from govt/regulators etc

how to invest in a industry - morning star book


standalone financial statements - reports findings of core activity of the company
u need to look at standalaone when the subisidaries of a company are listed. so that u get to know how the parent company is doing business
e.g: HDFC - subsidaries are HDFC bank, HDFC amc, HDFC life and all these 3 are listed
consolidated financial statements - reports all activities of a company, its subsidiaries as a combined entity
e.g L&T - certain subsidaries are not listed and hence u need to look at consolidated statement as the subsidary earnings are included in the consolidated statement
iii)balance sheet - quantitative analysis
solvency: ability to clear debt
liquidity: can it meet short term expenses
money to shareholders if liquidated: 
**liabilities: source of funds, i.e from where does the company get money from
Equity:
equity share capital - promoter share value
other equity - reserves + premium paid during IPO,FPO share offers
Non-current liabilities: to be paid for a period > 1 year
borrowings - long term debt
Other financial liabilities - like TDS for dividends declared
Other liabilities  -
Provisions - set aside some amount for unseen future expenses
Current liabilities: to be paid within 1 year
**assets: how the company is utilising the money
current assets - can be liquidated within a year
tangible assets(property,plants,equipments): the value is at the time company is incorporated adjusted with depreciation, 
market value might be much more

iv)profit and loss/income statement - quantitative analysis
Sales/revenue/turnover/topline
COGS - cost of goods sold (preparation/making price)
Gross Profit = sales - COGS
Gross profit Margin/Gross Margin = (gross Profit/sales) *100
consistent higher gross proft margin represents pricing power/brand/strong MOATs or company is reducing input costs
if 2 similar companies cost of goods sold remains but GPM is higher for a company implies company has competettive advantage
Operating expenses = salaries + building rent + advertising + marketing cost + cash burn to beat the price war + R&D cost 
EBITDA=Gross Profit - Operating expenses (profit earned by a company from its business)
depreciation expenses = capital goods(like electronics/machinery/buildings) value depreciates over time and is included in income statement over say 5-10 yrs
Amortisation expenses = same as depreciation but amortisation is for intangible assets like patents
Operating Profit /Operating income(EBIT) =EBITDA - Depreciation - Amortisation expenses=Gross Profit - Operating expenses - Depreciation - Amortisation expenses 
Operating Profit margin/Operating Margin =(operating profit/sales) *100
Operating profit margin shouldn’t be negative, consistent higher OPM implies having better/efficient management
PBT = Operating Profit /Operating income(EBIT) - interest payment on debt 
PAT/Net Income/Net Profit/BottomLine/Earnings = PBT - tax
ICR(interest coverage ratio) = EBITDA/Interest = will the company be able to pay interest on debt. ICR should always be high so that during recession company can interest on its debt without loosing assets.
ICR is not applicable for companies with 0 debt.

why EBITDA is important even thouh PAT/net profit exist?
for capital intensive business we need to look in to EBITDA, which gives us the actual operating income as dep & amor numbers will be high
for comparing actual operating income of old company (which already claimed dep and amo expenses) and new company(whose dep & amo expenses are being claimed)
also amortisation and depreciation are non-cash expenses, which doesn't go out from company's hand

v)cash flow statement - quantitative analysis
p&l statement can be manipulated. Also not all the net profit is received as cash, it takes time for the money to get credited 
also that money goes in to reserve section of balance sheet, hence analysing free cashflow is very important.
also check that net profit and cash flow should be in sync, if not investigate why company is not able to convert profit to cash

Cash flow from Investing activities - earnings or expenditures from non core activities like rent from long-term assets, such as buildings/equipment, investing in bonds,MFs, stocks of other companies etc
Cash flow from financing activities - cash flows between a company and its owners/shareholders and creditors from activities such as issuing bonds, retiring bonds, selling stock or buying back stock,IPO,FPO etc.
Cash flow from Operating activities(CFO) - earnings from core/daily activities of a company involved in producing and selling its product, generating revenues, manufacturing, sales, advertising, and marketing activities

free cash flow = owner’s earnings = Net Cash flow from Operating activities(CFO) - Capex
= net profit + non_cash expenses(like depriciation,amortisation) - change in working capital - Capex
owner’s earnings = if u buy a company u can take this free cash flow home , hence they become your earnings

Company is called extraorinary  if free cash flow > 70% of net profit (u can check freecashflow on tijori/morningstar)

**If free cash flow is high => assets increases => equity increases and ROE decreases
Hence companies either use it in Capex(capacity increase),R&D(tech companies), mergers(to acquire market share/expansion)
If a company has more cash in ideal mode then it might take wrong decision and everything gets screwed.
Hence they give it as dividend or buyback shares from open market then cash decreases and the ROE is less
Generally FMCG gives dividend and tech companies won’t rather they invest in R&D to keep ahead of competition.
**CAGR - compounded annual growth rate -  on an average return rate per year
For e.g: 2015 - investment year, 9% is CAGR which means from 2015 to 2016 there is 9% profit, and whole amount(principal + profit) is reinvested and then again 9% profit on the amount and so on
**Beta analysis
Beta - A positive beta value indicates that stocks generally move in the same direction with that of the market and the vice versa
For example, if beta is 1.3 and the market is expected to move up by 10%, then the stock should move up by 13% (1.3 x 10).

*track record: criminal, scams, warnings from SEBI/RBI - google search by promoter name / http://www.suchetadalal.com/
*should focus on business and not on additional stuff like share price
*regularly CFOs, auditors resign - avoid such companies
*management should do what they say and should take responsibilty of things that didn't work (past 5yrs management section)
*promoter pledging - know how much is pledged and the reason for pleding - if more shares are pledged company can go out of hand

***skill test: you can get it from company about section/ annual report management section(past 5 yrs)
qualifications(relevant skills are necessary)
experience(more experience means managers seen boom and burst and knows how to behave in each situation) 
mindset : growth, comfort zone - growth preferred
retained earnings: how is retained earnings used and what is the return on the invested earnings
age: if management is old, sucession plan is important

*life cycle of an industry - 4 stages
pioneering - EV, green energy
growth - internet

*further analysis
1)level of competetion - don't invest in industries where there is huge competetion within companies, as the pricing power decreases
2)threat of new entrants - how easy it is for a new entrant to disrupt the market share(jio for telecom, jiomart for dmart)
3)threat of substitutes - EVs vs auto industries, OTT vs TV channels
4)bargaining power of suppliers - if suppliers has more bargaining power than the company itself then profits will be skewed
5)bargaining power of buyers - if client base is limited then company doesn't have a choice but to sell the products 
at a lower price, if the buyer demands so
6)high entry barrier - is a good sign, capex heavy, momopoly, difficult to manufacture, strict regulations from govt/regulators etc

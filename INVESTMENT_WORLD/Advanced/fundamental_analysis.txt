FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS is broadly divided in to 2 :
1)QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS 
2)QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS: financial statements + business info(market size, market share, business model, revenue model, 
geographical presence)
also u can compare financial statements and business info across peers - which currently only tijori provides

2)steps/research involved :
mindset: analyse with a fraud identification mindset and not with a confirmation bias
i)management analysis - qualitative analysis

***integrity: how honest is the management and their moral values like not misusing cash in their favour,instead giving importance to shareholders
*remuneration : < 5% of profits | when company in bad state remuneration should be still lesser | should be in limits prescribed by MCA | 
search for management in annual report
*related party transactions: transactions to benifit holding company,director/director relations,key management and relations,subsidary companies
*track record: criminal, scams, warnings from SEBI/RBI - google search by promoter name http://www.suchetadalal.com/
*should focus on business and not on additional stuff like share price
*regularly CFOs, auditors resign - avoid such companies
*management should do what they say and should take responsibilty of things that didn't work (past 5yrs management section)
*promoter pledging - know how much is pledged and the reason for pleding - if more shares are pledged company can go out of hand

***skill test: you can get it from company about section/ annual report management section(past 5 yrs)
qualifications(relevant skills are necessary)
experience(more experience means managers seen boom and burst and knows how to behave in each situation) 
mindset : growth, comfort zone - growth preferred
retained earnings: how is retained earnings used and what is the return on the invested earnings
age: if promoter is old, sucession plan is important

ii)industry analysis
*life cycle of an industry - 4 stages
pioneering - EV, green energy
growth - internet
maturity/saturation - FMCG
decling - obselete - TV channels, print media
you need to identify the current phase of the industry and read reports on the industry
*REPORTS: read and findout the oppurtunities, profits scope and risks/threats involved in the industry

*further analysis
1)level of competetion - don't invest in industries where there is huge competetion within companies, as the pricing power decreases
2)threat of new entrants - how easy it is for a new entrant to disrupt the market share(jio for telecom, jiomart for dmart)
3)threat of substitutes - EVs vs auto industries, OTT vs TV channels
4)bargaining power of suppliers - if suppliers has more bargaining power than the company itself then profits will be skewed
5)bargaining power of buyers - if client base is limited then company doesn't have a choice but to sell the products 
at a lower price, if the buyer demands so
6)high entry barrier - is a good sign, capex heavy, momopoly, difficult to manufacture, strict regulations from govt/regulators etc

iii)financial statements analysis: quantitative analysis
standalone financial statements - reports findings of core activity of the company
u need to look at standalaone when the subisidaries of a company are listed. so that u get to know how the parent company is doing business
e.g: HDFC - subsidaries are HDFC bank, HDFC amc, HDFC life and all these 3 are listed
consolidated financial statements - reports all activities of a company, its subsidiaries as a combined entity
e.g L&T - certain subsidaries are not listed and hence u need to look at consolidated statement as the subsidary earnings are included in the consolidated statement

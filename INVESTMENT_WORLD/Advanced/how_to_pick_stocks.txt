******** Basic Screening of stocks *********
-- pick a stock using any ot the methods mentioned above
-- check if the company is present in https://www.valueresearchstocks.com/recos-current - read the report if stock is present
-- Normal check on stock price since inception - google search (steady growth or any abnormality observed)
-- if a share is falling: google search why a company share is falling - check news section in morning start/screener.in
And also check promoter shareholding pattern
Internal factors: then skip the company
External factors: then proceed with screening
-- get a gist by doing a Wiki search/about section in company website
-- will the sector do good in future ? I.e will there be demand for next  5-10 yrs
-- Earning power of the company: 
if B2C will public buy products of this company or will there be a demand in the future ?
if B2B then why will other companies keep buying their product at premium ?

If everything is GOOD then proceed with the fundamental analysis else repeat the process for another stock

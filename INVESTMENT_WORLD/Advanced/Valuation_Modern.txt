//some more modern ways
1)compare market cap with total cash(cash+cash equivalents - total debt)
if total cash > market cap OR total cash = 30% or market cap (then you are technically getting the share at 70% of share price)

2)compare market cap with free cash flow : 
if free cash flow keeps on growing and the free cash flow = 30% of market cap means you get your money back in 3 yrs and rest 
of your life you are getting things for free

3)if company has subsidaries , check their individual financial statements and calculate share price(EPS of Subsidary * Industry PE)
Actaul price of parent Share = total share price - subsidary share price - cash per share(apply 1st concept)
Actual PE pf parent share = Actaul Share price of parent/EPS of parent (standalone) 
if Actual PE pf parent share < Industry PE/historical average share price

4)mix of any two out of 1,2,3 OR mix of all 3(great combination)

5)predictions/forecast
PE: Industry PE, Historical Avg PE

---- Estimated Share Price based on Earnings:
//last 5yrs/10yr EPS growth rate?
5yr Estimated Share Price(Optimistic) = EPS(after 5yr CAGR) * Historical Avg PE
10yr Estimated Share Price(Optimistic) = EPS(after 10yr CAGR) * Historical Avg PE

5yr Estimated Share Price(Status quo) = EPS(after 5yr CAGR) * Historical Avg PE
10yr Estimated Share Price(Status quo) = EPS(after 5yr CAGR) * Historical Avg PE

5yr Estimated Share Price(Average scenario) = EPS(after 5yr CAGR) * Industry PE
10yr Estimated Share Price(Average scenario) = EPS(after 5yr CAGR) * Industry PE

---- Estimated Share Price based on cashflow:
//last 5yrs/10yr cashflow growth rate?
Estimated Share Price (Optimistic cashflow):
Estimated Share Price (Average cashflow):

note: Worst Scenario: you need to sell right away

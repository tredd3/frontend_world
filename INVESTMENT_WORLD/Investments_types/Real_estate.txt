Golden rule: 
like stocks keep Emotions aside and focus on Returns
like stocks and any other investemnts focus on price and don't over pay (fair price is still fine depending on location)

--------- why real estate? -----------
Capital growth(stocks) is required but income is also equally important hence real estate is once of the best options 
However real estate also provides capital growth as land appreciates but over the longterm the building value depreciates.
However you can claim that as a part of depreciation (if the family trust owns the building) - understanding taxation is the key 
 to success in real estate
But the most important reason should be income/rent as capital growth happens eventually without your intervention


--------- Look for the below ----------
1)strategy 1:
prime location (unique location like trees on both sides) - attracts high networth tenants
but don't get carried away with the asthetics/get emotionally attached and stuff (focus on numbers as well)
i.e, Net return = rent - maintenance cost(certain areas have high maintenance costs)
also try avoiding non unique properties like appartments, gruop houses where the pricing power lies with the tenant and not 
 the landlord unlike independent houses
proximity to transport, hospital
cafes,resturants,schools,offices etc
rental demand - rich tenants are preferred as it is a posh area
Tip: you can take loan and make the tenant pay the EMI, which means you will get the property for free

2)strategy 2:
quiet
remote area
upcoming areas because of purchasing power of surrounding public - early identification and pateince is required

3)strategy 3:
good area but the building has wear and tear and you are getting it at very discounted value
then you van quickly remodel with ur capital and rent it out at fair/more than market value because of the location

Common to both:
don't only rely on internet
go and checkout the area, drive/walk and get the feel 
tenant job must be good and he should be decent in behaviour
if the tenant is a family then they will have multiple cashflow


---------- Diversification within real estate: -----------
Residence (independent houses + appartments)
Commercial (office + establishments etc)

******* Investment options ******* 
Cash is a bad investment - put it in productive assets that can generate earnings and not in dead assets like Gold
Price of an asset depends on earnings and PE ratio, Which intern depends on demand and supply
Target  : Longterm
Invest every month is recommended. Sometimes u buy assets at more price ans sometimes but that is evened out at the end of the year.
However if you are sure that stock/unit is available dead cheap then go for lumpsum
 
//TAX - EPF,NPS,PPF etc
//WEALTH - MFs and STOCK MARKET

1st preference - Life insurance, 2nd preference - Wealth creation
//Life insurance 
Thumb rule - Never club investments with insurance
**Traditional insurance - waste of time, money(costliest form of insurance)
Problem : Less settlement amount and Lesser returns (fixed market returns - inflation)
As return is assured/fixed they invest in low risk assets hence lesser returns

**ULIP - insurance  +  investment (so many charges are deducted and then money is invested )
Problem: Less settlement amount and less returns(stock market returns - inflation - ULIP charges)
Solution: put some money in Term insurance(more settlement amount) + rest in MFs/Stocks
MF - expense ratio will be deducted and rest amount is invested

//stock markets
Shares - own knowledge -10% - high risk
Mutual funds - experts knowledge - 10yrs period - medium risk
Small cases - theme based stock selection like rural demand, infra special etc
Same like mutual funds but control is in our hands

//post office, FD, RD- low returns 

//LIC Jeevan Shiromani - per year 6 lakhs(1.1cr paid in total) - after 20 yrs - 2.25 cr
PPF - per year 3 lakhs -after 20 yrs - 1.3cr
ELSS/MF - index, equity, debt, hybrid

Gold -  high risk - invest in SGB (if u want to invest in gold)
Not recommended as a Investment - gold is a hedge against inflation
Rise in inflation by x% => rupee value depreciates by x% => dollar value interns of rupee increases
Gold is price is always decided interns of dollars, so as inflation increases gold value automatically increases (e.g corona times)
Price appreciation	 in gold is more due to increase in dollar valuation and less due to actual gold price
Bit coin - recently adopted by US and other companies, can be a game changer - but don't burm cash on it 
 only put the interest income on it protecting the capital.
Utility currencies: gold(make jewellery) , chocolates (u can eat)
Backing currencies: rupee(RBI backing), promissory notes(govt backing), bonds(corporate backing)

Real estate/Housing - price depends on kind of place , average income of the public at that place,
People sentiment etc
Should u buy a house? if the rent u pay and EMI difference is less then YES
Annuity - series of equal amount of payments at equal intervals of time for a given period
e.g: PFF, SIP etc
Perpetuity - for annuity total investment time is fixed time  but for perpetuity it is endless

Own business
Better than stock market but the risk of money being stalled for long term is possible
Choose ur business wisely
Donâ€™t depend only only business diversify it with investments and job etc

//investment in foreign markets
Developed countries - inflation is always lesser, say 2% => currency depreciates by 2%
Govt bond yield rates are lower - say 3% max 
Effective return = 3% - 2% = 1%
Developing countries - inflation is always higher, say 5% => currency depreciates by 5%
Govt bond yield rates are higher - say 6% max 
Effective return(interns of rupee) = 6% - 5% = 1%
When FII invest in developing countries like India for higher returns and then take back money after some years, there is a currency depreciation risk involved.

e.g: FII returns:
6% from Indian markets 
2% dollar depreciation - 5% rupee depreciation = -3% overall
Effective return (interns of dollar)= 6% - 3% = 3%
FIIs will face an issue when dollar appreciates and rupee depreciates further from the time of currency conversion

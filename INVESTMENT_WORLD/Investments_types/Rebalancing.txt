//checkout pyramid invesing - risk vs amount to be invested

It makes sense to remove excess money/ extraordinary gain that is generated and move that money to
risk free invetsments especially from crypto

high risk investments => pour less money
low risk investment(gold,real estate,FD etc) => pour more money

Use debt instruments for stability - if u feel stock markets are going to crash.
Once market crashes and starts to recover put all ur debt amount to equity for growth.

//python and its features

Features:
high level programming language
used for  developing both desktop(GUI), web applications,complex scientific and numeric applications(data analysis and visualization)
support various concepts in functional and aspect-oriented programming
dynamic type system and automatic memory management
interpreted programming language - allows you to you to run the same code on multiple platforms without recompilation
Robust Standard Library - u can choose from available modules without writing additional code
u can also choose from available python libraries
For instance, while writing a web application in Python, you can use specific modules to implement web services, perform string operations, manage operating system interface or work with internet protocols. 
Many Open Source Frameworks and Tools:
Likewise, you can accelerate desktop GUI application development using Python GUI frameworks and toolkits like PyQT, PyJs, PyGUI, Kivy, PyGTK and WxPython.
For instance, you can simplify and speedup web application development by using robust Python web frameworks like Django, Flask, Pyramid

Downsides:
Python is slower than several widely used programming languages including Java and C++. 
You have to speed up the Python application by making changes to the application code or using custom runtime.

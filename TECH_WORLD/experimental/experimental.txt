//Data Science World = Data analysts(exploration) + Statisticians(make a decision) + ML/AI(automation decision)
Data Science = making data useful (getting conclusions from data)
Data engineering = making data usable (filtering and structuring data so that DS team can use it)
1)Data analysts
hypothesis
speed
2)Statistics
data + assumptions = inference
3)ML/AI
algorithms - programming
applied mathematics - calculus, linear algebra, Statistics etc


//traditional programming vs ML
data + Rules => traditional programming => Output
data + Output => ML model => Rules

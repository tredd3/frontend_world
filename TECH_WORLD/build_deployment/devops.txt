DEVOPS stages:
1.Version control - source code management	
2.Continous Integration(CI) (Dev mode)- creating a build - after compiling, code review, unit testing(testing each part), integration testing(testing all parts together)
Since everything is automated in devops it is called continuous
JENKINS Is used here
3.Continous Delivery (QA mode)- deploying the build to test servers for UAT
4.Continous Deployment (customer mode) - deploying the build to prod servers
Docker is used here 
Docker image consists of all the project code
Docker container replicates production environment where we can deploy our code and test

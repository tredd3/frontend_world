Both faster and more disk-efficient than npm or yarn

pnpm is blazingly fast! pnpm outperformed other package managers in all installation scenarios.


With npm and yarn, running ten different projects could mean ten (or more!) copies of the same dependency installed.
This takes up a lot of physical space and inodes. pnpm's content-addressable file store and hard-linking strategy are much more
efficent, allowing you to work with many more projects at once. With pnpm you should rarely see errors like ENOSPC and Unknown system error -122 again!
